STR for Airtable is approved from security architecture.  Next steps:

•	Ensure an Inherent Risk Questionnaire (IRQ)* is completed in Archer to trigger a Vendor Risk Assessment (VRA).  
•	Work with your architect (I assume this is Barry) to get an iServer entry completed
•	Work with your architect or other IT Support folks to get the Airtable solution integrated into Ping (Global Auth).
•	Ensure all other architecture/on-boarding processes are complete

Current solution is in Prod for Pilot users.  Team has identified and explored this model which a distilled version of BERT and comparatively smaller, faster, cheaper, and lighter. Utilizing this model in the solution will offer improved accuracy for identifying and displaying responses to the User’s Natural language queries from the Verified Response Bank which will eventually influence the reduction in CHT (Call handling time ) of the Reservation Agents. 

The intent is to use this ‘Fine Tuned Bi-Encoder’ along with existing solution and invoke this Model for the cases where current Solution is giving ‘No Match’.  Ths model  DistilBERT will be used to fine tune the bi-encoder. The current version of GEN AI Solution in PROD uses ADA002 for the bi-encoding task from which likely candidates are then evaluated using a cross-encoder (RoBERTa-Large).

In the initial tests conducted, there seems to be positive improvement of the AI Solution after utilizing this model and specific to the semantic search where solution is able to identify responses to the similar queries from Verified Response Bank (VRB)

Video capabilities are present, but not used as a primary function or for inspection.

Images are captured via the drone’s camera and uploaded through the vendor’s iPad app, which is connected to the Mainblades server. The iPad app, or the web portal, is where the images are reviewed. 

Product is capable of inspecting an A/C 75% to 82% more quickly – directly drives reduction in high time non-routine AOS and IROP items, such as lightning strike inspections; completely removes Delta technicians and inspectors from having to access the top of the A/C for these tasks, which increases the inherent safety of accomplishment. Improves ability for engineer to assess aircraft condition.

No software needs to be loaded to Delta machines, no network access required as vendor has SIM card enabled iPad’s, no interfaces to Delta systems at this time. Should the need arise for us to request a data dump of our aircraft images, we would need to setup a pipeline to do so. Access is granted to vendor system through a registered email and password; Mainblades and TechOps Engineering jointly own permissions and access as well as enabling features for users based on qualifications. 

Computer Vision (CV) is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that trains computers to identify, interpret and track objects in photos and videos. The technology is primarily driven by recognizing patterns that repeat themselves over a given set of data. In Mainblades’ case that means identifying different kinds of damages on the fuselage of aircraft. To do that reliably, algorithms need to be trained by feeding large quantities of images with labeled objects. This allows the algorithm to establish a unique profile for each object. If this is repeated often enough it is eventually able to identify the objects in unlabeled images.

"iCoupon","Rajasekaran, Balaji",,,,"iCoupon","New","Passenger Movement (ACS)","ICoupon is a digital voucher technology solution that will be used when Delta is required to give meal voucher compensation to customers for a delayed or cancelled flight.
DL Agents will access the tool via a URL on their GX Pros or common use workstations. They can then activate the iCoupon for a full flight or specific customers. The technology assigns monetary value to the customers boarding pass barcode. Customers can then scan their boarding pass (whether it’s paper or digital) at participating retailers to pay for their meals. 
The technology assigns value to the barcode via flight number, flight date, and BCN.
ICoupon is used by many airlines, including Air France in CDG.
Currently stations use manual processing of vouchers via delta term or paper vouchers which has a high risk of fraud.

•	Our goal in Brand Strategy is to utilize Brand.Ai as a tool to guide and enhance our marketing and brand development, ensuring all materials are strategically aligned with our new brand guidelines, authentically connects with our target audiences, checks for brand consistency, surfaces potential cultural nuances, unifies with our new brand platform stance, and more. We'd like to use it Q1/Q2 now that we're developing new brand platform creative.
o	Given the 100 years Delta anniversary, the brand strategy team is working on a new brand VIS ID for Delta. It’s exciting to see the team is working on how we evolve the brand for the next 100 years by elevating the Delta brand for a holistic overall premium brand experience.

","Brand Opportunity with Vendor
•	Reason for working on this is that there hasn’t been a strong consistency across marketing, digital, CX, so this brand platform is truly meant to unify everything that we do at Delta to make sure everything feels cohesive. We are all marching to this idea of expanding people’s potential every day, so there is a new logo, color, tone of voice, etc. Therefore, we want to train Brand.ai to truly understand our new brand guidelines, who our audiences are, is this right for Spanish same as in English, does this celebrate diversity, etc. This is a tool we are hoping to use to drive that consistency, because with consistency comes strong brand power differentiation and more revenue. So, this is our way to adopt an AI tool of us unifying everything we can do. 

","Capabilities include: analyze business data, market trends, and cultural shifts to inform brand and creative strategy throughout the lifecycle of a brand

Delta/Vendor Engagement: 
•	A beta test relationship was offered to Delta mid last year. It’s important to find a mutually acceptable opportunity to test out some of this functionality. 
•	If we find Brand.ai incredibly helpful, we will want the license as an MVP user list for them and cost manageable. Internally, to have adoption we would need to have a couple of super users on there to evangelize and be able to share out the capabilities and opportunities. 
o	We don’t envision us going full scale for this in a fair amount of time 12-18 months if that is the course we take. It does have a lot of type of value with what we are doing with the new VIS ID and the new brand strategy to give us a certain level of consistency and gut checking on that 
•	Nathan Smith and Ryan McFerrin did connect on budget allocation for this POC and are both aligned from the cost perspective.

IBM mandates that a BigFix Agent is installed on each server to track PVU license consumption regardless of the environment.

The unique data generated from each server is collected and processed by ILMT at the end of the day automatically for PVU subcapacity tracking and audit purposes.
IBM recognizes that there are times when a server cannot provide PVU license consumption to ILMT. Thus, IBM has established a method to provide consumption data to ILMT through the “Disconnected Scanner” method, which requires the execution of a script that scans and collects PVU license consumption every 30 minutes on each server that cannot connect automatically to ILMT. The results are then packaged into a single file that will be later transmitted to ILMT.

Pilots utilize FCRs to provide crucial feedback on their flights, offering detailed accounts of incidents, irregularities, and valuable insights.
Misclassified Reports – Incorrect FCRs categorization can delay the response to critical issues, as the reports may not be routed to the appropriate departments promptly. Long text entries with incorrect categories can cause communication breakdowns, as the relevant information may not be easily accessible to the right personnel.

Proposed Solution for Gen AI-Powered Service for FCR - 
To address the request for a Generative AI (Gen AI) service for Flight Crew Reports using AWS services, the solution comprises two main components: a core FCR Gen AI Service built with AWS Bedrock, and an additional integration using Amazon Q Business and Amazon QuickSight for insights and visualization. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of how these requirements will be met and integrated into the FCR web application.

The business wants to enable users to effortlessly find and understand the data that’s most relevant to them via a natural language search feature to provide account specific data from within the b2b platform (Delta Professional). Search capabilities will be limited to data from within the Delta Global Sales CRM (Salesforce) and Sales Decision Support databases.

Agency and Corporate accounts have requested improvement in search capabilities on the site that is comparable to Other Airline sites. Lack of accurate search result on the site drives more than 150k calls per year to the sales support center which requires agents to answer. Also inconsistent agent response to frequently ask questions leads to customer dissatisfaction and dropped bookings. AI assisted search is expected to deflect 450 calls per day and provide consistent accurate answers concerning account status, benefits, contract performance and Delta policies.

This requirement can be fulfilled via zero-retention architecture that leverages Q Business and Bedrock Agent.

Positive results position the solution as a potential of integrating next-gen AI and modernizing current bot architecture.

Recommended action:  Deploy the MVP in a lower‑tier AWS environment and enable it only for calls that meet these business‑defined eligibility gates: gold members or above, travel date before 29 Sep, maximum 2 passengers, one‑way or round‑trip itineraries only, and credit‑card payment.

This AI-powered IDE represents a significant advancement in developer tooling that aligns with Delta’s digital transformation and developer experience initiatives.

The business case demonstrates strong potential ROI through projected 30-40% productivity gains and consolidated tooling costs. As an AWS product in tech preview, Kiro IDE offers Delta the opportunity to influence product development while gaining early access to cutting-edge AI development capabilities.
The solution adheres to both Delta’s AI Security Mandates and SaaS Security Mandates. The estimated cost of $25-30 per developer per month is reasonable given the comprehensive feature set and potential to replace multiple separate tools.

Key recommendations: 
1.	Start with a controlled pilot program (50 developers) in Q2 2025 
2.	Establish success metrics early to validate productivity claims 
3.	Develop comprehensive training program before mainstream rollout 
4.	Maintain existing IDE options during tech preview phase 
5.	Create feedback loop with AWS to influence product development
This implementation positions Delta at the forefront of AI-powered development practices while maintaining appropriate risk management through the phased approach.

With Agentforce sitting on the Salesforce Platform it has secure access to Salesforce data through built-in access security controls of Profiles, Permissions and role-based security that can leverage the principle of least privilege.

Agentforce is integrated with a Trust Layer to mitigate Generative AI risks. The Trust Layer ensures that responses your agents generate are grounded in your trusted company data. And its zero-data retention policy means that your company and customer information will never be released into the wild.

The Trust Layer detects potentially harmful LLM responses and includes event log monitoring for transparency in each user interaction. Topic instructions that define agent behavior also act as guardrails to prevent hallucinations and malicious attacks. The record and field access agents have, are permissions-based and can be set for different agent types and actions.

After a lot of experimentation with Amazon Nova Sonic and reading up on recent Polly improvements, I think Delta’s best option is to go with a third-party tool built specifically for this use case, like WellSaid. 
 
•	As of today, Nova Sonic is built for speech-to-speech use cases, where the model decides how to respond. While you can influence it with prompting and tooling, it’s not deterministic in nature and would not lend itself well to scripted training uses cases.

The diagram attached shows two aspects of the STO feature. The top process ""Process for Sending Email Campaigns in Salesforce Marketing Cloud with & Without STO"" outlines the people and systems involved in using this feature to illustrate it in a business context. The key element to highlight is the STO Score Assignment subprocess below the first diagram. As shown in the expanded diagram, the model can be run in two ways:
•	Using local (Delta-only) engagement data
•	Using a broader, anonymized dataset from all Salesforce customers (our preferred option)

Business Unit: Customer Experience Design (CXD)","Yes","yves.pojol@delta.com","Yes","COTS / Licensed","[""Solution utilizes AI Technology""]",,,"[""Additional AWS Infrastructure""]",,,,,,," Problem Statement: 

Our leaders rely heavily on data-driven decision-making. However, current tools and processes are not equipped to handle the scale, complexity, and speed required for analyzing qualitative text data such as customer verbatims. We need a scalable, secure, and easily integrable solution that enables advanced natural language capabilities—such as summarization, categorization, and sentiment detection—to extract actionable insights from unstructured textual data.

Example of data requests:  Teams frequently need to process large volumes of customer comments to uncover key themes, summarize feedback, and identify emerging sentiment. For instance, we may want to assess customer sentiment related to a specific KPI, while support teams need to categorize feedback to prioritize product or service improvements. These tasks require advanced natural language understanding and generation capabilities that exceed the functionality of traditional analytics tools.

How this is currently Handled:  Currently, we leverage model developed by Delta's Enterprise AI team, as we don’t own the process, its not scalable. When deeper insights are needed, team relies on data scientists to build custom models or scripts, which delays delivery and limits agility. There is no scalable platform for deploying generative AI models across teams.

Solution That Leverages AWS Bedrock:
By adopting AWS Bedrock, we can access a variety of foundation models (FMs) from leading providers (e.g., Anthropic, Meta, Stability AI) through a fully managed API-based service. This allows us to build and scale generative AI applications—such as comment summarization, feedback categorization, and sentiment detection—without managing infrastructure or training models from scratch.
1.	Model Flexibility and Choice:  Access to multiple foundation models for different use cases (text, image, chat, etc.)
2.	No Infrastructure Overhead: Fully managed service with no need to provision or maintain servers
3.	Customizability: Support for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning for domain-specific use
4.	Enterprise-Grade Security and Scalability: Built-in compliance, encryption, and access controls. Scales with usage and demand

","1.	 Improved Decision-Making:
•	Real-time insights from unstructured data
•	Faster identification of customer needs and pain points
2.	Operational Efficiency:
•	Reduces manual effort in analyzing and categorizing feedback
•	Frees up analysts and support teams to focus on high-value tasks
3.	Cost Savings:
•	Pay-as-you-go model eliminates upfront infrastructure costs
•	Reduces reliance on specialized AI/ML resources

Signifi Solutions is a vendor supplying smart modular locker system solutions to manage and track important assets available to users 24/7. Inflight Services Flight Attendant SkyPro loaner program leverages this solution ensuring that Flight Attendants have their operationally required SkyPro available for each flight. From an IFS base, a Flight Attendant approaches a Signifi kiosk. They will use the Emplifi solution (see Emplifi) to create a video chat session from the onboard tablet exposed within the kiosk. A SkyProfessor from the SkyPro Operations Support Center receives the chat request and validates the identity of the Flight Attendant. The SkyProfessor uses Impravata (GroundControl) to select and configure a device for the flight attendant. Impravata will call Omnissa Workspace ONE to retrieve the most recent configuration for the IFS Loaner Device. Once the device is configured, Impravata calls a Signifi API to release the appropriate drawer to the Flight Attendant. The Flight Attendant retrieves the device from the kiosk and continues to their flight.

When the loaner is no longer required, at any IFS base, the Flight Attendant will return to a Signifi kiosk. They will use Emplifi to create a video session. The SkyProfessor receives the chat and validates the identity of the Flight Attendant. The SkyProfessor will use Impravata to select a drawer and release the lock. The Flight Attendant will open the drawer and plug the device into the available charging cable. The Flight Attendant's loaner is marked returned and they continue with their day. Impravata will wipe the returned loaner and update iOS, if required.

Technology: 
Vision UI - Signifi software that is available to users to manage the kiosk transactions, but is replaced by the Emplifi interaction with the SkyProfessor. The kiosk runs a Chromium browser app using Ubuntu LTS. The kiosk software does not save any data locally beyond cached data for the kiosk cameras. All transactional data is sent/retrieved real time with their Vision Server. 
Vision Portal UI - Signifi companion back office software used by the cabinet administrator to configure the kiosk. A web application that manages users, transactions, and products. The SkyProfessor support team will have access to support the kiosks via this application. Control is enforced by user authentication and roles/groups. The Portal UI will be integrated with Delta SSO.
Vision Server - Central tool used for data aggregation and distribution. The server software has a heartbeat to the kiosk enabled to inform the server about the kiosk status. All transactions between the server and kiosk are executed using HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or 1.3. The servers run on ubuntu server with a PostgreSQL database. Data is encrypted at rest using full disk partition encryption (256-bit keys).

Signifi Solutions is approved for PCI compliance and undergoes annual penetration tests and assessments for their server and kiosk solutions.

"CoCounsel by ThomsonReuters with CoCounsel Drafting, an MS Word Add-In, and MS Outlook and MS Teams Add-Ins","Mimms, Carla A","Mimms, Carla A",,"Business Essential","ThomsonReuters","Existing","Legal","The Law Department will conduct a pilot of 5 AI chatbots, ultimately selecting one or a few to perform specific tasks within the Law Department.  CoCounsel is one of the 5 pilot participants

Thomson Reuters CoCounsel Core is a legal AI assistant that helps legal professionals rapidly pinpoint key knowledge, communicate complex information, and complete essential everyday tasks. Created for the exacting needs of the legal industry, its wide range of capabilities includes document review, contract analysis, summarization, and more. Over 1,400 law firms, government organizations, and corporate legal departments use CoCounsel Core to provide advice with unwavering confidence, expertly manage risk, and achieve more in less time. 

CoCounsel by Thomson Reuters is a secure, cloud-native legal AI assistant that integrates with Microsoft Word and supports SSO via SAML 2.0 or OIDC. It helps legal teams draft, review, and summarize documents using trusted content from Westlaw and Practical Law.

User data is encrypted in transit and at rest, never used to train AI models, and remains under user control. CoCounsel uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and includes source citations for transparency.  RAG is a technique which improves AI models by having them retrieve information from an external knowledge base before generating a response.

The Law Department is also going to use CoCounsel Drafting, an MS Word Add-In, and MS Outlook and MS Teams, available in the Microsoft App Store.

To evaluate the effectiveness of CoCounsel, Harvey AI, and GC AI, Delta’s Law Department will measure success across four key dimensions: (1) task efficiency, (2) output quality, (3) ease of user adoption, and (4) productivity enablement. Each tool will be tested against high-impact legal workflows such as first-pass contract review, clause extraction, legal research, and litigation brief drafting. 
(1)	Efficiency will be measured by the anecdotal reduction in turnaround time for these tasks, with a target of at least 30% anecdotal improvement overline baseline. 
(2)	Output quality will be assessed through pilot participant review, with particular consideration of correctness and alignment with internal standards.
(3)	User adoption will be anecdotally tracked through usage frequency, repeat engagement, and satisfaction scores. 
(4)	Productivity enablement will focus on how well each tool supports scalable legal support, reduces manual effort, and enhances transparency in legal reasoning. 
The vendor that demonstrates the strongest alignment with legal workflows, delivers measurable efficiency gains, and earns the highest user confidence will be selected for broader implementation. This approach ensures the chosen solution not only meets technical expectations but also empowers legal teams to operate with greater agility, compliance, and innovation.

The pilot will involve approximately 15 users from the Law Department.

The MS Add-ins probably won't install through Radia, but rather via Office 365

1.	General purpose, specifically for the legal function
2.	Legal productivity tool: perform first pass contract review (redlining)
3.	Writing a brief for a litigator

The Law Department is seeking an AI-powered general purpose chatbot and legal productivity solution that is purpose-built for legal professionals. While Copilot in Bing features general functionality, the legal field requires a specialized tool featuring RAG and other fine-tuning based on legal training data.  
 
These tools have specialized functionality, such as: 
 
1.	General purpose conversational chatbots, like ChatGPT or Copilot in Bing, but specifically trained for the legal function; and 
2.	Legal productivity tool: perform first pass contract review (redlining) and write a brief for a litigator. 


","The chatbot(s) will provide a more efficient method of doing business, particularly with contracts and other legal tasks.
The Delta Law Department is exploring the adoption of an AI-powered cloud-based legal technology platform to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and support strategic legal initiatives. These tools are designed to automate high-volume, low-complexity legal tasks—such as contract review, document drafting, and legal research—thereby freeing attorneys to focus on higher-value advisory and risk management work. 
 
By accelerating legal workflows and minimizing manual review time, such platforms can help optimize internal legal bandwidth, reduce reliance on outside counsel, and improve turnaround times. This aligns with Delta’s broader enterprise goals of innovation, agility, and cost efficiency. 
 
AI legal tools built for enterprise use typically deliver professional-grade outputs with minimal prompting, enabling consistent and scalable support across transactional and litigation matters. Industry benchmarks suggest that organizations implementing these solutions can achieve: 
 
•	20–40% reduction in time spent on routine legal tasks 
•	10–30% decrease in outside counsel spend 
•	Faster contract cycle times and improved compliance consistency 
 
These benefits translate into measurable ROI while also enhancing the legal department’s ability to respond quickly to business needs. 
 
Unlike general-purpose AI tools, legal-specific platforms are designed to prioritize accuracy, traceability, and explainability, context sensitivity, and domain relevance. This is critical in minimizing the risk of “hallucinations”—instances where AI generates plausible but incorrect or misleading information—which can have serious implications in legal contexts. A tool that understands legal language, structure, and standards helps ensure that outputs are not only efficient but also reliable, reducing the risk of reputational, regulatory, or financial exposure.  

","This solution offers two core capabilities tailored to the legal function: 
 
•	Specialized Legal Chatbot (Use Case #1) 
A domain-trained AI assistant that can interpret and respond to complex legal queries, summarize documents, extract key clauses, and assist with legal research. It enables attorneys to interact with large volumes of legal data conversationally, improving speed, accuracy, and decision-making. 
 
•	Legal Productivity Tools (Use Case #2) 
Includes advanced contract redlining and clause comparison features that automate first-pass reviews, flag deviations from standard terms, and suggest revisions. These tools significantly reduce manual effort, enhance consistency, and accelerate contract turnaround times. In addition, this use case includes rapid context-aware legal research and generates first drafts of litigation documents, memos, and correspondence, helping attorneys move faster while maintaining quality. 
 
Together, these capabilities help legal teams work smarter and faster—reducing bottlenecks, improving quality, and enabling scalable legal support across the enterprise.

","Customer data is securely stored in separate databases in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS). The servers hosting the third-party LLM do not retain any customer data processed by the models.

Access to CoCounsel Core is managed through OnePass.  The Thomson Reuters proprietary login solution stores the user account and password in a database table. The user account and the password are casesensitive and stored in the database as a salted hash value. The OnePass databases are encrypted to protect the confidentiality of user login credentials.  The solution provides an additional sign-on option of seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) integration using SAML, which simplifies the login process to a single platform. Utilizing SSO integration not only enhances security but also improves the user experience

Data processing is US based processing.  The data is stored in the GCP US West, and AWS East.  The data is co-mingled, but logically separated, tying each piece of data to the user or organization. Data is encrypted in transit with TLS 1.2+, and encrypted at rest with AES 256.  The user has full control of the data retention, and can go in and delete data in the UI at any time. Post pilot, the Law Department can request that data be sent back to the user or request that the data is deleted.  They are GDPR compliant.  

CoCounsel's cloud providers are GCP and AWS, with OCR processing in Azure. All pilot training is handled by CoCounsel's dedicated pilot team, with individual training sessions.

CoCounsel has 3 possible integration points with the Delta network: MFA/SSO, the Law Dept's document repository system, and with MS O365

As mentioned earlier, the Law Department will use CoCounsel Drafting, an MS Word Add-In during this pilot.  CoCounsel Drafting is a M365 add-in within the user’s Word application.  CoCounsel Drafting is hosted in Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  

 Security is embedded throughout the product with a focus on secure access, data privacy, 
and data security.  Customers are provided with secure login capabilities with encryption of 
customer data at rest and in transit throughout the product.  Key highlights of the product 
architecture include:
 • Customer content and user input are securely processed through the Word add-in, which 
is a web application that is hosted in the user’s browser
 • Word document storage remains within the ecosystem configured by the customer for 
their version of Word, ie, local hard drive, LAN shares, Data Management System (DMS), 
MS O365 tenant
 • Features invoked by the user may result in selected portions or the entire document content 
being securely transmitted to Thomson Reuters’ back-end service APIs in the cloud for 
fulfillment and execution of the features
 • AI Chat features are first securely processed in GCP, where the CoCounsel Chat service and 
the skills executor are hosted.  User prompt data is stored by the CoCounsel Chat service in 
the customer-specific database provisioned in CoCounsel to facilitate user review of chat 
history and to recall/refine previous prompts. This data is not used for any other purpose
 • Finally, user prompts (along with Word document data, if selected by the user) are then 
securely processed on our partner LLM servers.  Such servers hosting the AI models are 
contractually prohibited from retaining data or using it for any other purpose

 Customer content and data processed by CoCounsel Drafting is stored in regional 
databases in the US, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. The servers hosting the AI 
models do not retain any customer data processed by the models, and the models are not 
trained on any customer data.

All data is encrypted both at rest using AES-256 and in transit with TLS 12 or higher. We utilize 
native Key Management Service (KMS) with Customer Managed Keys (CMK) on each of the 
respective cloud platforms for encryption. The keys generated by GCP and AWS KMS, as well 
as Azure KeyVault are validated according to FIPS-140-2 standards.

 Access to CoCounsel Drafting is managed through OnePass and your Thomson Reuters 
Account. The Thomson Reuters proprietary login solution stores the user account and 
password in a database table. The user account and the password are case sensitive and 
stored in the database as a salted hash value. The OnePass databases are encrypted to 
protect the confidentiality of the login credentials provided by the user
 The solution additionally provides another sign-on option of seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) 
integration supporting any SAMLv2

","The Delta Law Department is exploring the adoption of an AI-powered cloud-based legal technology platform to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and support strategic legal initiatives. These tools are designed to automate high-volume, low-complexity legal tasks—such as contract review, document drafting, and legal research—thereby freeing attorneys to focus on higher-value advisory and risk management work. 
 
By accelerating legal workflows and minimizing manual review time, such platforms can help optimize internal legal bandwidth, reduce reliance on outside counsel, and improve turnaround times. This aligns with Delta’s broader enterprise goals of innovation, agility, and cost efficiency. 
 
AI legal tools built for enterprise use typically deliver professional-grade outputs with minimal prompting, enabling consistent and scalable support across transactional and litigation matters. Industry benchmarks suggest that organizations implementing these solutions can achieve: 
 
•	20–40% reduction in time spent on routine legal tasks 
•	10–30% decrease in outside counsel spend 
•	Faster contract cycle times and improved compliance consistency 
 
These benefits translate into measurable ROI while also enhancing the legal department’s ability to respond quickly to business needs. 
 
Unlike general-purpose AI tools, legal-specific platforms are designed to prioritize accuracy, traceability, and explainability, context sensitivity, and domain relevance. This is critical in minimizing the risk of “hallucinations”—instances where AI generates plausible but incorrect or misleading information—which can have serious implications in legal contexts. A tool that understands legal language, structure, and standards helps ensure that outputs are not only efficient but also reliable, reducing the risk of reputational, regulatory, or financial exposure. 

To evaluate the effectiveness of CoCounsel, Harvey AI, and GC AI, Delta’s Law Department will measure success across four key dimensions: (1) task efficiency, (2) output quality <checking for correctness/completeness/grounding to sources/hallucinations through verification of output by frequent spot-checking and confirmation during the pilot>, (3) ease of user adoption, and (4) productivity enablement. Each tool will be tested against high-impact legal workflows such as first-pass contract review, clause extraction, legal research, and litigation brief drafting. 
(1)	Efficiency will be measured by the anecdotal reduction in turnaround time for these tasks, with a target of at least 30% anecdotal improvement overline baseline. 
(2)	Output quality will be assessed through pilot participant review, with particular consideration of correctness and alignment with internal standards.
(3)	User adoption will be anecdotally tracked through usage frequency, repeat engagement, and satisfaction scores. 
(4)	Productivity enablement will focus on how well each tool supports scalable legal support, reduces manual effort, and enhances transparency in legal reasoning. 
The vendor that demonstrates the strongest alignment with legal workflows, delivers measurable efficiency gains, and earns the highest user confidence will be selected for broader implementation. This approach ensures the chosen solution not only meets technical expectations but also empowers legal teams to operate with greater agility, compliance, and innovation.

Flight Attendants have daily, direct interaction with Delta’s 200 million annual passengers, with a significant impact on the airline’s NPS scores. Their recognition as the #1 ranked US airline and a Top 15 ‘Company to Work For’ drives hundreds of thousands of FA applicants to apply. But this volume can create challenges in identifying the candidates who will provide the elite service which Delta expects.

The TA team is interested in exploring how technology and advanced analytics (including AI/ML) may help them establish standard benchmarks for FA talent, define “Candidate Quality””, ensure consistency over time, and better predict success in the role. This will aid the TA team in targeting the right talent for their pipeline, improving hiring rates during Event Days, and ensuring long-term success with the airline, all while positively enhancing customer experiences.
Additional areas of opportunity include:
• Assessing and optimizing the full process for FA hiring
• Benchmarking and scoring of interviews/assessments

"Figma AI","Mishra, Vipin","Mishra, Vipin",,,"Figma","Existing","Information Technology","Figma AI is a collection of features designed to help designers work more efficiently and creatively. Whether searching for inspiration, exploring multiple directions, or looking to automate tedious tasks, Figma AI was created designers can stay in the work.

Figma AI is currently in open beta so all features are free. Once available, it will become a paid feature but it will be included in Delta’s Enterprise plan.

Figma’s generative features are powered by third-party, out-of-the-box AI models. Certain AI features like Visual Search, Asset Search, and Add Interactions are fine tuned with data from public, free Community files. 

For all customer data, Figma:
•	Encrypts all data at rest and in transit
•	Uses security measures designed to protect against unauthorized access to customer data
•	Enforces tailored permissions and user access controls around who can view and access your data
When working with 3rd party companies to process data, Figma:
•	Does not permit 3rd party model providers to use data that customers upload or create on the Figma platform for training their own models
•	Limits how long vendors can store data. OpenAI and our other 3rd party model providers store data temporarily, or in some cases not at all, in order to process requests and enable AI features
Figma takes additional steps to train their AI models so that they learn general design patterns and Figma-specific concepts and tools—not your content, concepts, and ideas. For example, Figma de-identifes content and redact sensitive information including from text and images.

Admins have control over AI use and content training, which they can adjust with two new settings. Admins can turn these settings on or off at anytime. These settings control:
•	Access to AI features
o	For all plans: AI features are set to ‘on’ by default
•	Content training
o	For Enterprise, content training is set to ‘off’ by default
These are organization-level settings for Enterprise plans.

Flight Attendants have daily, direct interaction with Delta’s 200 million annual passengers, with a significant impact on the airline’s NPS scores. Their recognition as the #1 ranked US airline and a Top 15 ‘Company to Work For’ drives hundreds of thousands of FA applicants to apply. But this volume can create challenges in identifying the candidates who will provide the elite service which Delta expects.

The TA team is interested in exploring how technology and advanced analytics (including AI/ML) may help them establish standard benchmarks for FA talent, define “Candidate Quality””, ensure consistency over time, and better predict success in the role. This will aid the TA team in targeting the right talent for their pipeline, improving hiring rates during Event Days, and ensuring long-term success with the airline, all while positively enhancing customer experiences.

"Figma AI","Mishra, Vipin","Mishra, Vipin",,,"Figma","Existing","Information Technology","Figma AI is a collection of features designed to help designers work more efficiently and creatively. Whether searching for inspiration, exploring multiple directions, or looking to automate tedious tasks, Figma AI was created designers can stay in the work.

Figma AI is currently in open beta so all features are free. Once available, it will become a paid feature but it will be included in Delta’s Enterprise plan.

Figma’s generative features are powered by third-party, out-of-the-box AI models. Certain AI features like Visual Search, Asset Search, and Add Interactions are fine tuned with data from public, free Community files. 

For all customer data, Figma:
•	Encrypts all data at rest and in transit
•	Uses security measures designed to protect against unauthorized access to customer data
•	Enforces tailored permissions and user access controls around who can view and access your data
When working with 3rd party companies to process data, Figma:
•	Does not permit 3rd party model providers to use data that customers upload or create on the Figma platform for training their own models
•	Limits how long vendors can store data. OpenAI and our other 3rd party model providers store data temporarily, or in some cases not at all, in order to process requests and enable AI features
Figma takes additional steps to train their AI models so that they learn general design patterns and Figma-specific concepts and tools—not your content, concepts, and ideas. For example, Figma de-identifes content and redact sensitive information including from text and images.

Admins have control over AI use and content training, which they can adjust with two new settings. Admins can turn these settings on or off at anytime. These settings control:
•	Access to AI features
o	For all plans: AI features are set to ‘on’ by default
•	Content training
o	For Enterprise, content training is set to ‘off’ by default
These are organization-level settings for Enterprise plans.

","Optimized Carrier Selection & Freight Procurement	
              SAP TM uses automated carrier selection to choose the most cost-effective option based on our Delta routing guide.

Route Optimization & Load Consolidation	SAP TM minimizes distance traveled and fuel consumption. It also consolidates shipments by:
            - Maximizing container/truck space to reduce empty mileage.
            - Grouping shipments to avoid unnecessary partial-load costs.

Automated Freight Cost Calculation & Settlement	
            - Prevents billing errors & overcharges by automatically calculating accurate freight costs. 
            - Reduces manual effort by automating invoice matching & cost reconciliation with pre-agreed rates.

Real-Time Shipment Visibility & Risk Reduction (Global Track & Trace)	
            - Avoids expensive last-minute express shipping by tracking shipments proactively.
            - Minimizes disruptions by predicting delays and adjusting shipments accordingly.

Compliance & Customs Cost Savings	
            - Reduces penalties & delays by automating regulatory compliance.
            - Ensures accurate duty & tax calculations, avoiding unexpected fees.

Data-Driven Decision Making & Cost Analysis	
            - Predictive analytics help forecast demand, reducing unnecessary expedited orders.
            - Performance tracking identifies high-cost carriers & inefficient routes for cost-saving adjustments.

Sustainability & Fuel Cost Reduction	
            - Uses eco-friendly routing to reduce fuel consumption.
            - Encourages multi-modal transport (road, rail, air, sea) to optimize costs based on urgency & price.

Avoid Rogue Spend	Every order gets processed through TM to ensure we are leveraging company negotiated contracts

","SAP TMS provides a robust and scalable platform for optimizing transportation operations, with integrated planning, execution, and real-time visibility. Its connection to the SAP Business Network for Logistics (BN4L) SaaS platform enhances collaboration across logistics partners, aligning with Delta’s strategic goals for digital supply chain transformation. However, this implementation presents several architectural and operational concerns that must be addressed to ensure a secure, maintainable, and cost-effective deployment. The following is a non-exhaustive list of key issues identified:

A. Architectural Concerns
- Contractual Oversight: The contract was signed with minimal IT involvement, with no opportunity to assess perpetual licensing or AWS hosting under Delta’s account. The solution is not a true SaaS offering, despite being presented as a subscription model.
- Hosting Model Misalignment: SAP’s AWS-managed environment deviates from Delta’s cloud and security standards, where all systems are typically deployed under a single account with security groups used for isolation.
- Connectivity Ambiguity / Network Integration Gaps: SAP requires a delegated subdomain and dedicated IP ranges, introducing DNS and security complexities. Delta’s preferred AWS PrivateLink setup is not currently supported; VPN is the only viable alternative. If Delta cannot provide a dedicated subnet, it is unclear whether SAP will support NAT-based configurations, which introduce additional complexity and risk. Internal name resolution may also be problematic, especially as SAP will not be aware of NAT IP mappings on Delta’s side.
- System Build Inconsistencies: SAP’s initial configuration requirements (e.g., SID, client number, hostnames, security settings, Cloud Connector, Cloud ALM) remain unclear, increasing the risk of conflicts and support challenges.
- Security & SSO: Web UI must integrate with Delta’s IDP. SAP GUI requires either a security exception or use of BTP Secure Login. Dynamic user provisioning is not currently supported.
- Data Governance Risk: The absence of the SAP MDG add-on may lead to data quality degradation unless strong business-side controls are implemented (see STR for Westernacher / Syniti).

B. Operational Concerns
- No Sandbox Environment: Development systems must be tightly governed; irreversible changes require strict approval processes.
- System Refresh Limitations: The CPE contract limits the number of annual refreshes and introduces downtime before Delta teams can perform post-refresh tasks.
- Scheduling Constraints: Control-M cannot be installed on SAP-managed systems, requiring separate infrastructure for job scheduling.
- Monitoring & Change Management: SAP Cloud ALM is new to Delta and lacks a sandbox environment. Integration with PagerDuty and ServiceNow is still pending.
- User Provisioning Gaps: GRC 10.1 does not support S/4HANA. Until the AC12 upgrade (in progress), manual provisioning will be required.
- ECC Integration Complexity: DRF retrofit from EhP7 to EhP6 must be documented and validated in the ECC sandbox.
- BTP CPI Setup: Requires new IAS, SailPoint integration, and three CPI instances (Dev/QA/Prod), with estimated baseline costs of $15K/month, plus consumption charges.
- GTT Integration Challenges: Limited tenant availability (typically only QA and Prod), unclear 3rd-party integration (e.g., UPS, FedEx), and shared QA environment raise concerns.
- Data Lifecycle Management: No current ILM strategy exists. HANA performance and integration with Delta’s data lake remain unaddressed.","7/23/2025 12:46 PM",,"https://deltaairlines-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/joseph_brashear_delta_com/ES6iZiUlb3lJlEEfgbECoSwBFUy4vP-ZhpsHBXTgwe2wEQ","Loeffler, Scott","Blanc, JC",,"Final Copy","Blanc, JC","Sause, Dana J","Loeffler, Scott",,"anthony.rollins@delta.com;","stuart.smith@delta.com;brett.valentine@delta.com;","kim.baima@delta.com;bret.martin@delta.com;","matthew.penna@delta.com;","1,504",,"Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)","<p>Application Name &amp; Blockcode&#58;	 
No.	Mandate Description	Evidence/ comments about how this is achieved
S1	End-to-End Encryption - All data in transit and at rest must be encrypted, in compliance with our policies. This applies to data within the SaaS platform, and the integration or access to Delta systems.	SAP ensures robust encryption for both data in transit and at rest using AES-256 encryption standards and secure protocols like TLS 1.2 and SAP SNC. SAP HANA databases use built-in volume encryption, with keys securely managed via SAP’s Secure Storage File System or hyperscaler-native services like AWS KMS or Azure Key Vault, following strict segregation of duties. The SAP Private Cloud operates as an extension of the customer’s on-premise network, with the customer responsible for managing secure connectivity—commonly through VPN, MPLS, or cloud peering options.
S2	Authentication and Authorization	 
 	S2.A&#58; All Delta users must be authenticated by Global Auth, including MFA if required by Delta security standards. This requires a federated authentication integration with the SaaS provider.	SAP supports Multi-Factor Authentication through SAP Identity Authentication Service. If a customer uses their own Identity Provider that supports MFA, SAP solutions can inherit and enforce those MFA policies through standard integration, such as SAML 2.0. This allows customers to maintain control over their authentication requirements while leveraging SAP's secure infrastructure.
 	S2.B&#58; Credentials used for outbound APIs (i.e. Delta to SaaS provider) must be stored, controlled, and rotated in compliance with our Delta security standards.	Credentials used for outbound APIs (from customer to SaaS providers) are typically managed by the customer through their chosen middleware or integration layer. When using SAP Integration Suite or SAP API Management, customers retain control over credential storage, rotation, and access policies, aligning with their internal security standards. SAP provides secure options for credential handling, including encrypted storage and integration with identity providers, but credential lifecycle management remains the customer's responsibility.
 	S2.C&#58; All inbound APIs (i.e. SaaS provider to Delta) must be authorized using the Delta API Authorizer and must be processed through Akamai for our standard WAF and DDoS protection.	See above. 
 	S2.D&#58; Access to the SaaS solution, and roles within the SaaS solution must be controlled using AD groups managed by SailPoint, unless there is evidence of technical reasons this cannot be achieved	SAP cloud solutions offer flexible role-based permission controls to manage user access and responsibilities within the application. Roles can be configured to align with business workflows. Additionally, SAP Identity Provisioning Service enables integration with external identity systems, supporting automated role and user provisioning for efficient access management.
 	S2.E&#58; Authorization controls within the SaaS solution must be managed to enforce least privilege. For example, general users should not have &quot;tenant&quot; admin privileges.	Access Management. Access controls provide identity management and grant appropriate access rights (“Access Management Controls”). Access Management Controls are designed to follow the principles of “least privilege,” “need-to-know,” and “segregation of duties.”

Personnel Access. SAP personnel are issued a unique identifier to access SAP’s systems. SAP maintains written procedures to administer access authorization changes and access rights are revoked when personnel are no longer authorized to access applicable systems (e.g., termination of employment).

Administrative Rights. Administrative rights are only assigned to privileged and technical SAP users on a “least privilege” and “need-to-know” basis.

Please see the SAP Cloud solution in scope SOC2 report as these processes are attested to within. https&#58;//www.sap.com/about/trust-center/certification-compliance.html#soc
S3	Cloud Access Security Broker - The SaaS solution must be integrated with the Delta CASB, unless there is evidence of technical reasons this cannot be achieved.	This needs to be discussed on what CASB Delta is using and how it's being used. 
S4	Direct Data Connections (this includes any direct data connectivity such as to databases, message queues, cache services, service bus, file systems, object stores, file transfers, etc.)
 	S4.A&#58; Inbound connections from the SaaS provider to Delta data sources directly via the Internet are not permitted. API, proxy, or other intermediary connectivity solutions must be included so the data sources do not need to be publicly accessible.	Inbound connections from SAP cloud services to customer data sources are not made directly over the public Internet. Instead, integration is handled through secure intermediaries such as SAP Integration Suite or customer-managed middleware, ensuring that data sources remain non-public and protected within the customer's controlled network.
 	S4.B&#58; Credentials used to authenticate all direct data traffic must be stored, controlled, and rotated in compliance with our Delta security standards.	Credentials used for authenticating direct data traffic in RISE with SAP are managed by the customer when using integration services or middleware. SAP supports secure credential storage and encrypted communication, but credential lifecycle management—including storage, control, and rotation—remains the customer's responsibility to align with their internal security standards.
 	S4.C&#58; Data access controls, and data that is uploaded to the SaaS platform must be strictly limited to only the data necessary for the SaaS solution to function correctly.	Data uploaded to SAP cloud solutions is strictly limited to what the customer, as the data owner and controller, chooses to provide. The customer manages user access and permissions, ensuring that only the necessary data required for the solution's functionality is shared and accessed.
S5	Logging - The SaaS provider must offer logging or a way to view events for important transactions (e.g. logins, high-value transactions, administrative changes, etc.)	SAP cloud services support multi-layered logging and audit capabilities. At the infrastructure and platform levels, SAP logs system events, configuration changes, and security-relevant activities, which are monitored through centralized Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to help detect and respond to potential threats. These logs support SAP’s responsibility for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the service.This is attested to within the SAP Cloud SOC2. 

At the application level, audit trails capture changes such as data modifications, configuration updates, and integration activities, including timestamps and user IDs. These logs are accessible via the SAP cloud application. In SSO-enabled environments, user authentication and identity-related logs typically reside with the customer's Identity Provider (IdP), as identity verification is managed externally. Customers are responsible for monitoring and managing those IdP-level logs as part of their access governance and compliance processes.
S6	Restrict Network Access - The Delta tenant of the SaaS solution must only be accessible from the Delta network unless there is a business requirement to allow access from the public Internet.	In RISE with SAP, network access to the customer tenant is restricted by default and can be configured to allow access only from the customer’s network. Public Internet access is only enabled if explicitly required by the customer for specific business scenarios, ensuring controlled and secure connectivity.</p>","<p></p>","Yes","6/25/2025 11:31 AM","1504","7/25/2025 3:18 PM"

The Service Provider will also intelligently route customer interactions to existing Delta-built intents within Amazon Lex, ensuring previously developed conversational flows are leveraged wherever applicable to maximize reusability and accelerate time-to-value. Such an agentic AI-powered telephony tool will be powered by the large language model created and hosted by Netomi (the “Netomi Hosted LLM”). Netomi Hosted LLM models used within the scope of this SOW will comply with Delta-approved LLMs as listed below: 
 
GPT 4 and 4o 
Claude V2, 
Titan XL, 
Embed Multilingual Cohere 
 
As part of this SOW, Service Provider will collaborate with Delta to enhance the existing IVR system with an agentic AI-powered solution. This engagement will include a discovery and evaluation phase during which the current IVR experience, contact drivers, and volume trends will be assessed to identify key areas for optimization in both customer experience and system performance. 
 
Additionally, Service Provider and Delta will work together to define and finalize the scope of functionality for the new AI-driven IVR experience. This will include a collaborative process to prioritize high-impact use cases, establish a solution architecture, and align on key performance objectives. 
 
While final scope of functionality will be refined collaboratively during the discovery phase of the project, the core areas of work are expected to include: 
Knowledge Agent Configuration & Deployment 
Configuration of an AI Knowledge agent capable of dynamically generating accurate, relevant responses to customer inquiries using Delta approved knowledge sources. The knowledge agent will be grounded in approved and curated content sources provided or validated by Delta. These sources may include, but are not limited to, publicly available content on Delta.com, Delta’s own Knowledge Management system in Sharepoint, and any other documents, website, or resources approved and provided by Delta. 
Action Agent Configuration & Deployment 
Design and implement AI Action Agents that integrate with Delta’s internal systems to execute tasks where required to fulfill customer requests and execute end-to-end transactions. A tiered, phased approach prioritizes integration with Delta systems according to high-impact intents. Each phase introduces additional transaction automation. The rollout plan below aligns with Delta’s current initiatives but can be adjusted as needed. 
Phase 1: Deployment of Informational Use Cases and Core Technical Integration 
In Phase 1, the Service Provider will enable the handling of informational queries while completing the technical setup required to integrate the agentic AI platform with Delta’s existing IVR infrastructure. This includes: 
Integration with Delta’s existing ecosystem, including access to backend APIs, which will serve as the foundation for deeper transactional use cases in future phases. 
Integration with Delta’s throttling logic to ensure traffic is directed to the Service Provider in a controlled and optimized manner. 
Implementation of an agreed-upon fallback approach to ensure service continuity and redundancy, maintaining a consistent experience for Delta customers at all times. 
This phase lays the groundwork for scalable automation and more advanced use case enablement in subsequent phases. 
Phase 2 and Beyond: Enablement of Transactional Experiences 
In subsequent phases, the focus will shift toward enabling transactional experiences within the Service Provider’s agentic AI platform. This will involve deeper integration with Delta’s backend systems to support personalized and action-oriented customer interactions. 
Examples of recommended use cases are provided below; however, final scope and sequencing will be subject to alignment and confirmation with the Delta team. The goal is to collaboratively prioritize high-impact experiences that drive efficiency and enhance the customer journey. 
Phase 2: Book a Ticket, Baggage - Pre Trip, Medallion / Promo Questions, Seat Selection, SSR   
Phase 3: SkyMiles Redemption, Change Booking, Upgrade, Flight Status 
Phase 4 and beyond: Book a Ticket (MFoP), Cancel (OFoP, RFC, etc.), Baggage - Post-Trip, Refund Status 
Amazon Connect Integration 
Configuration and integration with Amazon Connect to support seamless escalation of AI-handled calls to Delta’s live human support agents. 
Conversational IVR Experience Design 
Development of a natural language IVR flow that enables customers to interact conversationally. This experience will be designed to improve usability, reduce friction, and enhance customer experience. ","The ability for the IVR to contain and deflect inbound volume, relieving the need for Res agent to handle customer requests.  The goal is to contain ~10% of inbound volume.","Introduce AI and LLM based processing to improve conversation experience and ability to handle customer needs in a more seamless manner.

No.	Mandate Description	Evidence/ comments about how this is achieved
S1	End-to-End Encryption&#160;- All data in transit and at rest must be encrypted, in compliance with our policies. This applies to data within the SaaS platform, and the integration or access to Delta systems.	SAP ensures robust encryption for both data in transit and at rest using AES-256 encryption standards and secure protocols like TLS 1.2 and SAP SNC. SAP HANA databases use built-in volume encryption, with keys securely managed via SAP’s Secure Storage File System or hyperscaler-native services like AWS KMS or Azure Key Vault, following strict segregation of duties. The SAP Private Cloud operates as an extension of the customer’s on-premise network, with the customer responsible for managing secure connectivity—commonly through VPN, MPLS, or cloud peering options.
S2	Authentication and Authorization	
	S2.A&#58;&#160;All Delta users must be authenticated by Global Auth, including MFA if required by Delta security standards. This requires a federated authentication integration with the SaaS provider.	SAP supports Multi-Factor Authentication through SAP Identity Authentication Service. If a customer uses their own Identity Provider that supports MFA, SAP solutions can inherit and enforce those MFA policies through standard integration, such as SAML 2.0. This allows customers to maintain control over their authentication requirements while leveraging SAP's secure infrastructure.
	S2.B&#58;&#160;Credentials used for outbound APIs (i.e. Delta to SaaS provider) must be stored, controlled, and rotated in compliance with our Delta security standards.	Credentials used for outbound APIs (from customer to SaaS providers) are typically managed by the customer through their chosen middleware or integration layer. When using SAP Integration Suite or SAP API Management, customers retain control over credential storage, rotation, and access policies, aligning with their internal security standards. SAP provides secure options for credential handling, including encrypted storage and integration with identity providers, but credential lifecycle management remains the customer's responsibility.
	S2.C&#58;&#160;All inbound APIs (i.e. SaaS provider to Delta) must be authorized using the Delta API Authorizer and must be processed through Akamai for our standard WAF and DDoS protection.	See above. 
	S2.D&#58;&#160;Access to the SaaS solution, and roles within the SaaS solution must be controlled using AD groups managed by SailPoint, unless there is evidence of technical reasons this cannot be achieved	SAP cloud solutions offer flexible role-based permission controls to manage user access and responsibilities within the application. Roles can be configured to align with business workflows. Additionally, SAP Identity Provisioning Service enables integration with external identity systems, supporting automated role and user provisioning for efficient access management.
	S2.E&#58;&#160;Authorization controls within the SaaS solution must be managed to enforce least privilege. For example, general users should not have &quot;tenant&quot; admin privileges.	&quot;Access Management. Access controls provide identity management and grant appropriate access rights (“Access Management Controls”). Access Management Controls are designed to follow the principles of “least privilege,” “need-to-know,” and “segregation of duties.”

Personnel Access. SAP personnel are issued a unique identifier to access SAP’s systems. SAP maintains written procedures to administer access authorization changes and access rights are revoked when personnel are no longer authorized to access applicable systems (e.g., termination of employment).

Administrative Rights. Administrative rights are only assigned to privileged and technical SAP users on a “least privilege” and “need-to-know” basis.

Please see the SAP Cloud soltuion in scope SOC2 report as these processes are attested to within. https&#58;//www.sap.com/about/trust-center/certification-compliance.html#soc&quot;
S3	Cloud Access Security Broker&#160;- The SaaS solution must be integrated with the Delta CASB, unless there is evidence of technical reasons this cannot be achieved.	This needs to be discussed on what CASB Delta is using and how it's being used. 
S4	Direct Data Connections&#160;(this includes any direct data connectivity such as to databases, message queues, cache services, service bus, file systems, object stores, file transfers, etc.)	
	S4.A&#58;&#160;Inbound connections from the SaaS provider to Delta data sources directly via the Internet are not permitted. API, proxy, or other intermediary connectivity solutions must be included so the data sources do not need to be publicly accessible.	Inbound connections from SAP cloud services to customer data sources are not made directly over the public Internet. Instead, integration is handled through secure intermediaries such as SAP Integration Suite or customer-managed middleware, ensuring that data sources remain non-public and protected within the customer's controlled network.
	S4.B&#58;&#160;Credentials used to authenticate all direct data traffic must be stored, controlled, and rotated in compliance with our Delta security standards.	Credentials used for authenticating direct data traffic in RISE with SAP are managed by the customer when using integration services or middleware. SAP supports secure credential storage and encrypted communication, but credential lifecycle management—including storage, control, and rotation—remains the customer's responsibility to align with their internal security standards.
	S4.C&#58;&#160;Data access controls, and data that is uploaded to the SaaS platform must be strictly limited to only the data necessary for the SaaS solution to function correctly.	Data uploaded to SAP cloud solutions is strictly limited to what the customer, as the data owner and controller, chooses to provide. The customer manages user access and permissions, ensuring that only the necessary data required for the solution's functionality is shared and accessed.
S5	Logging&#160;- The SaaS provider must offer logging or a way to view events for important transactions (e.g. logins, high-value transactions, administrative changes, etc.)	&quot;SAP cloud services support multi-layered logging and audit capabilities. At the infrastructure and platform levels, SAP logs system events, configuration changes, and security-relevant activities, which are monitored through centralized Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to help detect and respond to potential threats. These logs support SAP’s responsibility for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the service.This is attested to within the SAP Cloud SOC2. 

At the application level, audit trails capture changes such as data modifications, configuration updates, and integration activities, including timestamps and user IDs. These logs are accessible via the SAP cloud application. In SSO-enabled environments, user authentication and identity-related logs typically reside with the customer's Identity Provider (IdP), as identity verification is managed externally. Customers are responsible for monitoring and managing those IdP-level logs as part of their access governance and compliance processes.&quot;
S6	Restrict Network Access&#160;- The Delta tenant of the SaaS solution must only be accessible from the Delta network unless there is a business requirement to allow access from the public Internet.	In RISE with SAP, network access to the customer tenant is restricted by default and can be configured to allow access only from the customer’s network. Public Internet access is only enabled if explicitly required by the customer for specific business scenarios, ensuring controlled and secure connectivity.</p>","<p></p>","Yes","6/30/2025 6:55 AM","1513","7/23/2025 7:35 AM"

slow analytics, and operational inefficiencies. Databricks addresses these by unifying data processing,
analytics, and AI on a single platform, eliminating silos and streamlining workflows. Its Lakehouse
approach allows teams to access consistent, reliable data, while its integration with AWS infrastructure
ensures performance and scalability. Databricks also simplifies the deployment of generative AI and
advanced analytics, making it easier to move from experimentation to production within a governed
environment.

Fragmentation: Siloed services (e.g., Glue for ETL, Redshift for warehousing, SageMaker for
ML) create integration hurdles and inconsistencies.

Complexity: Orchestrating secure, reliable, and performant pipelines across distributed data and
teams is operationally complex.

Advancing AI Initiatives: Running Gen AI workloads at scale requires specialized infrastructure,
seamless access to fresh, high-quality data, and governance controls.

Databricks addresses these challenges by delivering a unified platform that streamlines analytics,
enforces data governance, and accelerates the adoption of generative AI and machine learning at an
enterprise level.","Databricks delivers measurable business value by:

Accelerating Time to Insights: Unified analytics and ML workflows minimize
development cycles and promote data reuse, enabling faster and more informed
decision-making.

Boosting Productivity & Collaboration: Collaborative workspaces, shared assets, and
standardized practices reduce silos and foster cross-team innovation.

Enabling Trust & Compliance: Robust governance and lineage tools reduce risk,
streamline audits, and ensure data privacy and regulatory compliance, which is
increasingly critical across industries.

Driving Innovation with Gen AI: By making generative AI accessible on enterprise
data, Databricks unlocks new revenue streams, enhances customer experience, and
streamlines operations through automation.

Reducing Operational Overhead: Fully managed infrastructure, scalable compute, and
unified security simplify operations and reduce TCO (total cost of ownership) versus maintaining separate,
piecemeal solutions.","Lakehouse Storage with ACID transaction support (via Delta Lake) for unified batch and
streaming data processing.
Interactive and Scheduled Notebooks supporting multiple languages (SQL, Python, Scala, R),
built-in visualization, and version control.
Automated Data Ingestion and ETL with job orchestration, scheduling, and built-in connectors
for common data sources (AWS S3, RDS, Redshift, external APIs).

Unified Governance through Unity Catalog for consistent access control, data discovery,
auditing, and lineage tracking across all Databricks workspaces.

Secure Data Sharing internally and externally via Delta Sharing protocol.
Advanced Analytics with built-in MLflow for experiment tracking, model management, and
production deployment.

Support for Gen AI and LLMs: Integration with open-source models, Databricks Foundation
Model APIs, vector search capabilities, and tools for building RAG (Retrieval Augmented
Generation) systems using enterprise data.

Scalable Compute: Elastic clusters managed by Databricks, optimized for both performance and
cost.

Integration with AWS Services: IAM for secure authentication/authorization, S3 for storage,
CloudWatch for monitoring, and seamless deployment in AWS-native environments.","On AWS, Databricks is deployed in the customer's own AWS account (customer-managed VPC
deployment) or as a Databricks-managed environment, depending on preferences and security
requirements.

Data Residency: All data storage, including raw, processed, and analytic datasets, remains
within AWS regions selected by the customer. Databricks operates directly on the customer's
Amazon S3 buckets, and no data is moved out of the region unless explicitly configured by the
customer.

Data Processing: Compute resources (Databricks clusters) are provisioned within the customer's
environment, using EC2 instances, ensuring compliance with AWS region residency policies and
security postures.

Security & Compliance: Databricks leverages AWS-native security features—such as
encryption at rest/in transit, KMS key management, network isolation (VPC), and PrivateLink—for
secure data access and processing. Customers retain control over data egress, storage
locations, and auditability.

Governance: Unity Catalog ensures data access is restricted according to enterprise policies,
and all activities are logged for regulatory compliance.

This architecture ensures that Databricks meets stringent enterprise requirements for data residency,
security, and sovereignty within the AWS ecosystem, while enabling secure and scalable analytics and AI
processing.","AWS Bedrock, AWS Sagemaker","Team will have to reduce capacity or increase in size to meet the business demand and additional cost will have to be spent.","There is no cost to the POC, and the vendor will cover the cost of running the AWS services","NA","NA","NA","TBD - cost of running AWS services (EC2, MSK, DMS, S3)","Will be supported by the EDS (Enterprise Data Services) teams.","NA POC","Reduction of specialized skills, increase in data quality, increase speed to value","NA","Amburkar, Shashank",,,"NA POC",,"PIA-37463713","Running the POC is the following account: tera-edw-dev-037661190395","NA POC","N/A",,"Testing Databricks to be architected as a Lakehouse using Delta Lake for structured zones, Unity Catalog for governance, and MLflow for scalable AI workflows.

There are no prior STRs (Security and Technology Reviews) on file for this vendor. Transcarent already has Single Sign-On (SSO) integration through Quantum Health, which supports SSO access for all benefit participants. Delta only brokers services for employees, who represent just a subset of the total participant population.","No","roger.peterson@delta.com","No","COTS / Licensed","[""No""]","SaaS","No",,,,,,"No",,"The primary business driver for this request is to provide employees with comprehensive support for upcoming surgeries through access to high-quality care and streamlined coordination. Transcarent (formerly BridgeHealth) offers a Care Coordinator Program that connects employees with top-performing surgical facilities and assigns a dedicated care coordinator to guide them through every step of the process. This not only improves health outcomes but also enhances the employee experience by reducing complexity and stress during a critical time.

From a technical perspective, the integration with Transcarent is supported by Single Sign-On (SSO), which has been established through Quantum Health. This ensures secure and seamless access for all benefit recipients—not just Delta employees—reflecting the broader scope of the program. The use of SSO also aligns with enterprise security standards by minimizing authentication risks and improving user experience.

Additionally, all data exchanged and retained by Transcarent is governed by HIPAA regulations, ensuring that personal health information (PHI) is protected with strict confidentiality and security measures. Data retention policies are compliant with HIPAA requirements, safeguarding information throughout its lifecycle.

To further align with enterprise IT governance, we are currently pursuing SaaS Mandate responses from Transcarent. This will help validate their compliance with our internal standards for data privacy, security, and system integration.","The integration of Transcarent’s Care Coordinator Program delivers significant value to both employees and Delta as a self-insured organization.

Improved Employee Support: Employees facing surgery are connected with a dedicated care coordinator who guides them through every step—from selecting a high-quality provider to managing logistics. This personalized support enhances the employee experience, reduces stress, and promotes better health outcomes.

Access to High-Quality, Cost-Effective Care: Transcarent partners with top-rated surgical facilities, ensuring employees receive high-quality care at predictable, bundled rates. This model helps avoid unnecessary procedures and complications, which can drive up costs.

Cost Savings for Employees and Delta: Employees benefit from reduced out-of-pocket expenses due to the fixed-cost structure for surgeries. In turn, Delta benefits from lower overall claims costs, which directly impacts the company’s bottom line as a self-insured entity. By steering care to high-value providers, the program helps control rising healthcare expenses while maintaining quality.

Secure and Compliant Integration: The program is supported by Single Sign-On (SSO) through Quantum Health, ensuring secure access for all benefit recipients. All data handling complies with HIPAA regulations, protecting personal health information and aligning with enterprise data governance standards.

Ongoing Compliance and Risk Management: Delta is actively pursuing SaaS Mandate responses from Transcarent to ensure continued alignment with internal security, privacy, and compliance requirements.","Transcarent provides the following key business capabilities under the L3 of ""Surgical Navigation Support Administration""
-Surgical Care Navigation: Connects employees with high-quality surgical providers and facilities.
-Personalized Care Coordination: Assigns a dedicated care coordinator to guide employees through the entire surgical journey.
-Cost Transparency and Predictability: Offers bundled, fixed pricing for surgeries, reducing financial uncertainty for employees.
-SSO-Enabled Access: Ensures secure, seamless access for all benefit recipients via Single Sign-On through Quantum Health.
-HIPAA-Compliant Data Handling: Maintains strict data privacy and security standards for all personal health information.
-Cost Containment for Delta: Reduces overall healthcare spend by steering care to high-value providers, benefiting Delta as a self-insured employer.

AuditBoard is an application used by Corporate Audit and wants to add AI functionality to an existing product. 
 
AuditBoard AI utilizes machine learning to power two new capabilities: “Generative” and “Intelligent Recommendations”. The Generative feature allows for the AI service to propose wording for control, risk, and audit description fields in the product. The Intelligent Recommendations feature proposes mappings to consider across controls and frameworks within AuditBoard. In both cases, the user is responsible for reviewing and accepting the output. There is no automated decision making involved. 

AuditBoard can support multiple risk assessment methodologies. Upon creation of a risk assessment, users can choose which methodology to apply. Automated scoring for risk assessments exists today. Calculations can be customized to meet the needs of the customer. For example H, M, L ranking of risk factors can drive the overall inherent risk rating, and Control Strength can be used in combination with this to determine overall residual risk.

TCS MasterCraft provides an automated approach to modernize the legacy mainframe applications, delivering the
desired output with considerable saving in effort ,time and Cost. The product takes an AI-first approach towards Legacy modernization by
augmenting several of its core features with AI/ Gen-AI capabilities. It addresses typical challenges faced by enterprises during their
legacy modernization journey:

Application Analysis: Lack of sufficient documentation on the legacy system and/ or unavailability of Subject Matter Experts results
in gaps in application knowledge due to which there is a risk of missing out critical functionalities during the transformation to the
new system. TCS MasterCraft™ enables Application Analysis, it can automatically analyze the existing legacy code to generate
Application insights.

Natural to Java Code Conversion: Traditional Application development techniques are unable to handle the speed and complexity
of today’s dynamic business requirements. Organizations are looking for automated development platforms with Forward
Engineering capabilities to enable agility and rapid innovation. The TCS MasterCraft™ modernizes the large-scale application from
legacy to modern tech stack leveraging GenA

Why are they not using Q CLI or the other tools GenAI code assist tools?  We cannot use Amazon Q alone to get Natural/Cobol + Adabase broken down into java. We also will need to extract the files that are in Ctrl-M and batch jobs from Mainframe and Reverse engineer and then pick and choose to go forward. We will most probably have a discovery phase and involvement with Business to check if we want to add any other functions too.","No","JasmineE.Patridge@delta.com","Yes","COTS / Licensed","[""Solution utilizes AI Technology""]","PaaS","No",,"Linux OS Packages",,,,"NA","Yes","Delta IT - Revenue Accounting is requesting a proof of concept from TCS in converting a 30 year old mainframe application (SOFRS) from Natural Adabase to Java.  TSC has a proprietary technology (TCS Master Craft) that they use to convet mainframe technology to modern distributed application source code (in this case Java).  Approval of TCS Master Craft for use in the POC is required.  The application will be installed temporarily (during the POC period) on AWS ECS virtual machines (standard Linux image)  and then removed (and the EC2 instances decommissioned) after the POC is complete.  

LLM Recommendation:
Anthropic models accessed via Amazon Bedrock are recommended as the preferred long-term solution.
For the pilot phase, the OpenAI GPT-4o model may be utilized alongside Anthropic models for a limited duration of up to six months.   FYI Team met with Brett Valentine to discuss the LLM model and to get guidance on this.
","The business benefit is a streamlined and fast process to convert 30 year old mainframe code to an modern Java source code so that  the application can be quickly migrated from the mainframe environment to a distributed environment where it can be modernized with readily available development resources.  Currently SOFRS is supported by a single Delta IT employee (developer) so there is continnual risk to the business while this application continues to run on the mainframe.

Delta Global Sales would like to pursue this platform to help manage their deployments, particularly for admin-side configuration, to ensure rollback is possible (very cumbersome in standard Salesforce) and it is easier to control change. Delta is looking to utilize Copado as a DevOps solution to help manage deployments, including of configuration-based functionality, within the Salesforce core/CRM platform.  ","Copado delivers significant business value by accelerating release cycles through automated CI/CD pipelines, which reduces deployment time and increases delivery speed. Its integrated toolset improves developer productivity by minimizing manual work and rework, while fostering better collaboration across cross-functional teams. With built-in compliance, audit tracking, and rollback capabilities, Copado reduces deployment risk and ensures regulatory alignment. Additionally, its robotic testing offers end-to-end, scriptless automation that scales across platforms, lowering QA effort and increasing test coverage. These efficiencies contribute to faster time-to-value and can lead to measurable cost savings in development labor, reduced downtime, and fewer production defects—supporting a strong ROI as outlined in the business case justification. ","Copado offers a robust set of business capabilities that streamline and govern the software delivery lifecycle. These include centralized version control for managing Salesforce metadata, CI/CD automation to accelerate build, test, and deployment processes, and user story management for full traceability from development to release. It also provides environment management to detect conflicts and dependencies early, and release governance features such as role-based approvals and policy enforcement to ensure compliance and reduce deployment risk. Together, these capabilities support faster, more reliable, and audit-ready software delivery. ","Copado is a CI/CD application and it only deals with salesforce code.

They have many complex business process flows, reports, etc. that they maintain, outside IT processes.  Currently, they have no automated way to manage deployments or track changes to the processes logic, site configuration, etc.  Copado provides deployment management, change tracking, and rollback capabilities to a process that covers 8+ Salesforce Orgs (Prod, SI, Stage, and several development orgs).  It replaces an almost entirely manual change management DevOps process.  Compared to competing Salesforce DevOps tools, Copado is widely considered to be the best, both for its user-friendly UI with point-and-click management (targeting a non-IT user base), and enterprise grade control and governance.

Since Global Sales uses Salesforce for sensitive Delta-proprietary data and processes, the Global Sales IT team and Delta Salesforce COE have partnered with Global Sales business and Copado to allow all source code (aka Salesforce metadata) to be stored in the Delta GitLab instance; as opposed to using a public GitHub repo.  This required creation of a solution developed in partnership with the Delta DevOps team, and approved by Security, to expose a public integration endpoint, allowing Copado to connect to the Delta GitLab instance from outside the Delta firewall.

I recommend proceeding with Copado.  It provides much needed process automation and source control that is lacking in this very large Salesforce instance.  Other than initial setup mentioned above, it is not anticipated to require ongoing IT support.

No.	Mandate Description	Evidence/ comments about how this is achieved
S1	End-to-End Encryption - All data in transit and at rest must be encrypted, in compliance with our policies. This applies to data within the SaaS platform, and the integration or access to Delta systems.	Open encryption methodologies are used when communicating within our infrastructure and via public networks. The Jabra Xpress solution is only accessible using HTTPS on TLS (v1.2 as a minimum).
Data at rest is encrypted using Microsoft Transparent Data Encryption (TDE - Transparent data encryption - Azure SQL Database &amp; SQL Managed Instance &amp; Azure Synapse Analytics.

Microsoft Learn, with AES 256 as encryption algorithm). As a multi-tenant solution, the encryption key is shared for all customers, and it is not maintained by Jabra but Microsoft. S2 Authentication and Authorization S2.A&#58; All Delta users must be authenticated by Global Auth, including MFA if required by Delta security standards. This requires a federated authentication integration with the SaaS provider. MFA is not available for customers currently and the access to the web service is done through username and password. Federated access is currently not available. S2.B&#58; Credentials used for outbound APIs (i.e. Delta to SaaS provider) must be stored, controlled, and rotated in compliance with our Delta security standards. There are no APIs available for customers. The APIs currently in use are the ones required to communicate data from endpoints to our cloud service, which is done through a publicly available secure API. S2.C&#58; All inbound APIs (i.e. SaaS provider to Delta) must be authorized using the Delta API Authorizer and must be processed through Akamai for our standard WAF and DDoS protection. There are no APIs available for customers. The APIs currently in use are the ones required to communicate data from endpoints to our cloud service, which is done through a publicly available secure API. S2.D&#58; Access to the SaaS solution, and roles within the SaaS solution must be controlled using AD groups managed by SailPoint, unless there is evidence of technical reasons this cannot be achieved Currently, two different type of users are available - regular user and administrator, which is able to perform changes to Jabra Xpress customer own configuration. S2.E&#58; Authorization controls within the SaaS solution must be managed to enforce least privilege. For example, general users should not have &quot;tenant&quot; admin privileges. Currently, two different type of users are available - regular user and administrator, which is able to perform changes to Jabra Xpress customer own configuration. Moreover, production environment and systems are only accessible to specific team members, following need to know and least privilege principles, and these are tracked together with their level of access. Likewise, all administrative actions are monitored and logged accordingly. S3 Cloud Access Security Broker - The SaaS solution must be integrated with the Delta CASB, unless there is evidence of technical reasons this cannot be achieved. Yes. S4 Direct Data Connections (this includes any direct data connectivity such as to databases, message queues, cache services, service bus, file systems, object stores, file transfers, etc.) S4.A&#58; Inbound connections from the SaaS provider to Delta data sources directly via the Internet are not permitted. API, proxy, or other intermediary connectivity solutions must be included so the data sources do not need to be publicly accessible. Not applicable since Jabra Xpress is not pulling any data from Delta data sources. S4.B&#58; Credentials used to authenticate all direct data traffic must be stored, controlled, and rotated in compliance with our Delta security standards. If this refers to JXO authenticating to Delta data sources, then this is also not applicable. S4.C&#58; Data access controls, and data that is uploaded to the SaaS platform must be strictly limited to only the data necessary for the SaaS solution to function correctly. As by default, Jabra Xpress doesn't log any customer personal data (username and computer name). This option can be turned on and off by the customer -by default, it’s off-. In the case that the setting is turned on and then turned off, the data collected will be eventually deleted in 30 days if the device does not communicate with Xpress after that period. Data minimization is implemented in Jabra Xpress solution; hence, data actively collected (device list -inventory-, and analytics) are stored for 30 days. After that period, the data are deleted automatically if the device has not communicated with Xpress. All device-related information such as configuration, and user account information do not have an expiration and they are removed upon request as part of applicable privacy laws compliance. S5 Logging - The SaaS provider must offer logging or a way to view events for important transactions (e.g. logins, high-value transactions, administrative changes, etc.) Audit logs are accessible to certain authorized personnel, but these logs are not reviewed regularly for security events. The Jabra Xpress environment utilize the built-in Azure Application Insights resources (together with Azure Smart detection), to monitor elements such as&#58; request, availability, and response time. Audit logs are available for 90 days. Both the SaaS solution and its logging system use the same Azure App Service for time sync (no real NTP server involved). S6 Restrict Network Access - The Delta tenant of the SaaS solution must only be accessible from the Delta network unless there is a business requirement to allow access from the public Internet. JXO UI solution is designed as a public web portal, allowing customers to sign in using their username and password. This portal is accessible over the Internet. Our solution is built using a multi-tenant architecture, where customers share resources in Azure. While data is isolated using unique identifiers, the network access remains open to accommodate the shared nature of the application.</p>","<p>NA</p>","Yes","7/28/2025 12:38 PM","1595","8/6/2025 9:06 AM"

Production incidents today require manual log searches across fragmented dashboards, leading to high MTTR and SLA breaches.

The IntelliLog Assistant represents a forward-thinking approach to log management by leveraging AI to automate log ingestion, parsing, and analysis. Its Spring Boot foundation ensures a robust and scalable backend, while the configurable nature of the tool suggests a modular design that can adapt to various log formats and sources. However, bypassing established platforms like Sumo Logic or CloudWatch introduces challenges around scalability, security, and observability. Without native integrations, the system must handle ingestion pipelines, storage, indexing, and alerting internally, which can increase operational complexity. Additionally, the AI-driven components require careful tuning and monitoring to ensure accuracy and avoid false positives or missed anomalies.

Recommendation:
To accelerate development and validate the IntelliLog Assistant’s AI-driven capabilities, it is recommended to grant the application team controlled access to an AWS AI/ML account for a limited-scope proof of concept (POC). This will enable the team to experiment with services such as Amazon Bedrock, SageMaker, or Comprehend for log classification, anomaly detection, and natural language summarization. Leveraging AWS-managed AI services can significantly reduce the time and complexity of building custom models from scratch, while also ensuring scalability and security. The POC should be time-boxed and governed by clear usage policies, with cost monitoring and IAM role-based access controls in place to ensure responsible experimentation.","8/4/2025 8:43 AM","1 month","https://deltaairlines-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/joseph_brashear_delta_com/EVWXRxxnWeFGlEANRSlYwwwBO-xTJnYWHqhQMfyAa3b0kQ",,"Chen, Jay",,"Draft","Chen, Jay",,"Schulz, Vicky H (A9)","8/31/2025 12:00 AM","anthony.rollins@delta.com;","stuart.smith@delta.com;brett.valentine@delta.com;","kim.baima@delta.com;bret.martin@delta.com;","matthew.penna@delta.com;","1,602",,"Financial Document Management","<p></p>","<p>Sanitize inputs, Strip or redact any detected passwords/API keys before sending logs to the LLM.

This product introduces a modular, intelligent robotic system capable of automating repetitive and injury-prone tasks, such as dish handling and drink tray assembly, without requiring changes to existing workflows.","Developer Tool","[""Permanent Production""]",,"8/4/2025 12:00 AM",,"Pending",,,,,"Pending","Pending","Pending","Pending","0",,"No","srinadh.avula@delta.com","No","COTS / Licensed",,"SaaS","No",,,"N/A","N/A",,"Yes","Yes","​​ The IntuitiveMotion.AI solution is designed to address critical labor, safety, and quality challenges in Delta’s high-volume airline catering operations. This product introduces a modular, intelligent robotic system capable of automating repetitive and injury-prone tasks—such as dish handling and drink tray assembly—without requiring changes to existing workflows. 

​Business Drivers: 
​Labor Shortages & Retention: Industrial kitchens face chronic staffing challenges, particularly for high-turnover, low-desirability roles like dishwashing. Our automation reduces this dependency and stabilizes operational throughput. 

​Worker Safety: Our system minimizes exposure to burns, repetitive strain injuries, and other OSHA-reportable risks, directly reducing worker compensation claims and insurance premiums. 
​Operational Consistency: Automation ensures uniform handling and quality compliance, critical for food safety, customer experience, and brand protection. 

​Technical Rationale: 
1. ​Our robots deploy and require no custom infrastructure, and integrate seamlessly via real-time edge processing. 
​2. The system uses a secured WebRTC-based teleoperation and monitoring stack, compliant with enterprise network policies and encrypted end-to-end. 
3. ​It generates high-fidelity operational and vision data to improve forecasting, compliance, and future AI learning—supporting Delta’s long-term digital transformation goals. ","Loading/unloading robot station each replaces tasks of 1 worker. There are 2.5 shifts per day. Each robot is $30-50k per year. ","The IntuitiveMotion.AI system enables several transformative business capabilities for Delta’s kitchen and flight operations: 

1. Real-Time Operations Visibility: Operations managers can monitor dish throughput, task completion rates, and labor efficiency live—helping identify delays, bottlenecks, or underutilization. 
2. Loss Detection (""Bleeding"") Alerts: The system can detect when dishware fails to return in time from aircrafts, prompting an early alert. This reduces the need for emergency dishwashing of new inventory and ensures smoother flight prep cycles. 
3. Compliance, Quality, and Safety Assurance: Embedded vision systems continuously check for chipped dishware, food debris, and proper utensil setup—helping prevent service disruptions and food safety issues. This proactive QA layer supports regulatory compliance and protects Delta’s premium in-flight service reputation. 
4. Data-Driven Optimization: Every robot interaction and camera observation contributes to a growing dataset used to optimize resource planning, staff allocation, and training—all accessible through a dashboard. 

These capabilities drive tangible improvements in operational resilience, safety, and customer experience consistency across catering hubs. ","​​Currently camera image data is the only data captured externally. They are processed locally and removed each time robot reboots (every 1-6 hours). ","​While several automation technologies exist, most fail to meet the adaptability, deployment speed, and compliance monitoring needs of high-volume airline catering operations. Below are potential comparisons: 

​Comparable Products: 

​Chef Robotics 

​Focus: Robotic arms for food assembly. 

​Limitations: Requires structured conveyor layouts, limited adaptability to unstructured tasks like dish handling or tray loading. 

​Miso Robotics (Flippy, Sippy) 

​Focus: Robotic burger and fry stations. 

​Limitations: Designed for QSR; not optimized for high-throughput dish operations or catering logistics. 

​Humanoid Robots (Tesla Optimus, Apptronik) 

​Focus: General-purpose manipulation. 

​Limitations: High cost, complex integration, slow to deploy, and operationally fragile in fast-paced kitchen environments. 

​Internal Delta Solutions (if any): 

​We are not aware of any existing Delta-approved solutions that combine robotics, real-time vision QA, and teleoperation tailored to dishware and catering compliance workflows. ","N/A","Hardware: 2-6 modular robots _ camera QA Systems -> $15,000 - $20,000 per unit 
​Installation Fee: Site survey, robot setup, calibration, safety validation -> ​$5,000 per robot 
​Engineering Support: ~200 hours of on-site field engineering support (robot integration + Delta-specific customization)  -> ​$40,000 (included in pilot bundle) 
​Training & Onboarding: Operator/technician training, documentation, handoff -> ​$2,000

Traditionally, AI tools relied on static images or API responses to interpret design intent, but the MCP server changes this by offering a standardized way to deliver structured design data to large language models (LLMs). This enables tools like GitHub Copilot, Amazon Q Developer, and AWS Kiro to generate code that aligns more closely with the actual design and existing codebase. The server supports features like extracting variables, components, and layout data, and it can generate code from selected frames in Figma using popular UI frameworks like React, Tailwind, and SwiftUI. It also includes Code Connect, which maps Figma components directly to their codebase counterparts, ensuring consistency and reducing guesswork in code generation.

This MCP server is SaaS-based and there is no additional cost. The authorization and authentication for the remote MCP server follows existing access entitlements within Figma and utilizes their browser user-agent and authorize the MCP client with a specific MCP OAuth scope.","Developer Tool",,"2/28/2025 12:00 AM","8/6/2025 12:00 AM",,"Pending","Yes","Yes",,,"Approved","Approved","Pending","Approved","1","9/2/25: MCP STRs are on hold until the proper controls are in place

Avinym simplifies this by offering a centralized, browser-based platform that includes a global AIP library and automated alerts for updates and revisions.

This tool enhances operational efficiency by ensuring timely access to critical information without requiring data integration or sharing. Its ease of use and relevance to navigation and planning make it a strong candidate for adoption following a trial evaluation.","Avinym streamlines access to global Aeronautical Information Publications (AIPs), reducing manual effort, improving update visibility, and enhancing operational accuracy for flight planning and navigation.

","It provides a centralized AIP library, automated alerts for country-specific updates and revisions, and a browser-based interface for quick access and reference.

","Avinym is a browser-based solution with no data integration or sharing. All data remains external, and no Delta data is stored or processed within the tool.

","There are no known approved tools at Delta that offer the same centralized AIP access and update alerting. Current processes rely on manual procurement and monitoring from individual country sources.

","The team would continue manually sourcing AIPs from multiple providers, increasing workload, risk of missed updates, and operational inefficiencies.

","There are no one-time costs associated with implementation. Avinym is currently being evaluated through a free trial, with no integration or infrastructure changes required.

","None required. The solution is cloud-hosted and accessed via standard web browsers.

","Negligible. No dedicated IT support is needed. OCC users will manage access and usage directly.

","No formal operational support from Delta IT is expected. Vendor support would be leveraged for any product-related issues.

","Not applicable. Avinym is hosted externally and does not utilize Delta’s AWS environment.

","Avinym requires minimal ongoing support. As a browser-based tool with no integration into Delta systems, day-to-day usage will be managed by OCC business users. Any product-related issues or enhancements will be handled directly through vendor support channels. No dedicated Delta IT resources are expected for operational maintenance.

","Minimal support required. OCC users will manage day-to-day usage, with vendor-provided support available for product-related issues. No dedicated Delta IT support is expected.

","No new skills or tooling are required. Ownership will reside within the OCC team, with existing staff able to use the tool without additional training or technical onboarding.

","Avinym may reduce reliance on manual AIP sourcing and tracking processes, potentially retiring fragmented workflows and subscriptions to individual country publications.

",,,,"Operational risk is low due to Avinym’s non-integrated, browser-based nature. The primary risk is reliance on vendor uptime and accuracy of AIP updates. This is mitigated by maintaining access to existing AIP sources during the trial and validating Avinym’s alerts against known updates before full adoption.","37465229","PIA-37465397","Begin with a limited trial within the OCC team to validate functionality and fit. Feedback from users will guide next steps toward broader adoption.

","If the trial proves successful, the tool will be rolled out to relevant OCC teams involved in navigation and flight planning. Licensing and vendor engagement will be formalized post-trial.

","Use is limited to OCC operational teams. The tool is not integrated with Delta systems and is intended solely for reference and monitoring of AIP updates.

","No internal repository required. The product is accessed via the vendor’s site: https://avinym.com

","Avinym presents a low-risk, high-value opportunity for OCC operations. Its browser-based architecture eliminates the need for integration, infrastructure changes, or data residency concerns. The tool aligns well with OCC’s business needs by centralizing AIP access and automating update notifications. Given its minimal IT footprint, ease of use, and operational relevance, it is recommended to proceed with the trial and evaluate for broader adoption based on user feedback and vendor performance.

"Lineal - eDiscovery for CrowdStrike Litigation","Luth, James","Luth, James",,"Business","Lineal","New","Legal","eDiscovery is the process of identifying, collecting, and producing electronically stored information (ESI) for legal or regulatory purposes. It’s commonly used during litigation, investigations, or audits to gather relevant digital data such as emails, documents, chats, and files.

The vendor Lineal, will be providing the same services as KLDiscovery, the current eDiscovery provider does, but are using Lineal for their expertise, specifically in the CrowdStrike Litigation.  This is a review tool used by legal teams for reviewing and production of documents in active litigation. Only attorneys would have access to the data in the tool.   

Lineal is providing eDiscovery and forensics services for litigation matters. They have specific expertise and tools that are needed (and that our other eDiscovery providers do not have), and that is why we need to onboard them. They offer Relativity – which is a standard in the eDiscovery world – with their own add-ons which make it different than going directly to Relativity. It is used to process, review and produce data that is relevant to the litigation. This process is required for all of our litigations, and certain matters require certain expertise (i.e. an IP litigation is different from a Second Request is different from an Antitrust action.). As such, we cannot use just one vendor for all of our needs. 
Only attorneys have access to the database as all work product and data collections are protected by the attorney-client privilege. 
Any AI being used also falls under attorney-client privilege. We are not generating NEW data, the analytics and AI functions are only used to categorize/review our documents so that we can produce the relevant/not privileged docs. 
The vendor services being provided are a combination of SaaS and Professional Services.  The technology that the Delta eDiscovery team will be using is not a separate subscription/installation.

- SFTP - Standard transmission of eDiscovery collections is by SFTP: Lineal has the capability to receive electronic files directly from clients using a secure mode of electronic transmission. We use the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) that requires SSH to be enabled. All data in transit is encrypted using TLS (version 1.2), VPN, and SFTP. All data at rest uses encryption with AES 256 algorithm.  
- Encrypted hard drives - For very large eDiscovery collections, transmission is by Physical Transmission: As a standard, they transfer data using 2TB encrypted hard drives. Amanda has the additional approvals required by Delta for using encrypted hard drives for processing.

MFA access management:
Amanda (manager for the Law Department's eDiscovery team) is the only one who will be approving access to the Lineal workspaces. Only individuals specifically working on the matter (inside attorneys and outside counsel) will be provided access credentials. Also, Amanda audits the access log every month to remove access for anyone who has not logged in within the past 30 days.  SSO is not feasible because of all the outside counsel that needs access.

- When a litigation matter is completed and Delta no longer needs to preserve the collected data, the workspace is deleted along with all originally collected data. Then, internally, Amanda's team removes the legal hold from Delta systems (because we preserve the original data in-place in our own environment.) The vendor keeps none of our data. Part of the reason all this goes through Amanda's team – so they can track where Delta's data is and make sure it’s deleted when it’s no longer needed. 

- Contract terms - The SOW lists dates the rates will be applicable, and SCM/Amanda's team reconnects with the vendor when the SOW is up for renewal to determine how to proceed for the next 1-3 years.

Introducing k6-operator
k6-operator is an implementation of the operator pattern in Kubernetes, defining custom resources in Kubernetes. The intent is to automate tasks that a human operator would normally do; tasks like provisioning new application components, changing configurations, or resolving run-time issues.

The k6-operator defines the custom TestRun resource type and listens for changes to, or creation of, TestRun objects. Each TestRun object references a k6 test script, configures the environment, and specifies the number of instances, as parallelism, for a test run. Once a change is detected, the operator will react by modifying the cluster state, spinning up k6 test jobs as needed.","Developer Tool","[""Permanent Testing Env""]",,"8/18/2025 12:00 AM",,"Approved",,,,,"Approved","Approved","Approved","Approved","0",,"No","jacob.clouse@delta.com",,"Free / Open-Source","[""No""]","PaaS","Yes","[""N/A""]","New OpenShift Operator","https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/testing-guides/running-distributed-tests

From a business perspective, it reduces complexity for developers and operators by enabling natural language–driven operations, while also promoting community adoption through its move into the neutral Containers organization. Technically, it avoids external dependencies by being written in Go and connecting directly to the Kubernetes API instead of wrapping CLI tools. It exposes controlled, schema-defined operations like listing pods, retrieving logs, or describing resources, which makes automation more secure and predictable than granting full CLI access. Overall, the project addresses both the operational burden of Kubernetes management and the need for a community-driven, AI-ready interface to clusters.","The business benefit of the Kubernetes MCP Server is that it lowers the cost and effort required to operate Kubernetes by enabling AI-driven automation and reducing manual intervention. Today, cluster troubleshooting, log retrieval, and resource inspections can take engineers hours of context switching across CLI tools, whereas with MCP these tasks can be streamlined into natural language interactions that resolve issues faster and with fewer mistakes. This leads directly to cost savings in reduced Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) for incidents, less time spent on repetitive operations, and faster onboarding for new engineers who no longer need deep Kubernetes expertise to perform common tasks. The ROI comes from labor savings, higher platform availability, and the ability to scale operations support without scaling headcount proportionally. In short, MCP Server drives efficiency, reduces operational overhead, and improves reliability—resulting in measurable cost savings across both infrastructure operations and developer productivity.","The Kubernetes MCP Server delivers several business capabilities that directly support efficiency and scale in Kubernetes operations:

1. **AI-Assisted Operations** – Enables natural language interaction with clusters, allowing engineers and support staff to diagnose and resolve issues faster without needing deep Kubernetes expertise.
2. **Operational Efficiency** – Automates repetitive tasks like retrieving logs, checking pod status, or describing resources, reducing manual work and freeing engineers to focus on higher-value activities.
3. **Faster Incident Response** – Lowers Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) by providing quick, structured access to cluster information through AI agents, improving service uptime and reliability.
4. **Workforce Scalability** – Reduces the learning curve for new hires, making it easier for less experienced engineers to perform Kubernetes operations safely, which helps scale teams without proportional increases in training costs.
5. **Governance and Security** – Offers a controlled, schema-defined interface to Kubernetes resources, ensuring that AI-driven automation adheres to RBAC and enterprise security policies, mitigating risk compared to exposing raw CLI access.
","For the Kubernetes MCP Server, data residency follows the location of the Kubernetes cluster and the MCP server instance where it is deployed. All data—such as pod logs, resource descriptions, and API responses—is retrieved directly from the Kubernetes API and processed locally within the cluster or the environment hosting the MCP server. No data is sent externally by default; processing occurs in the same infrastructure where the server is running, under the enterprise’s existing compliance and security controls. This ensures that residency aligns with the organization’s cloud or on-premises policies (e.g., AWS region, private datacenter, or hybrid environment). If integrated with an AI assistant, residency will then depend on that assistant’s deployment model (enterprise self-hosted vs. SaaS), but the MCP server itself does not persist or transmit data outside of the managed environment.","N/A","N/A ","None ","None","None","None","None","Teams updating and using latest version of the MCP Server",,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://github.com/containers/kubernetes-mcp-server","Good tool for developers to use to leverage MCP servers to interact with kubernetes ","10/3/2025 7:44 AM",,"https://deltaairlines-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/joseph_brashear_delta_com/ETcuBj2vWBpCrdf0ZURPQMoBOJGiGW72iRgN-A9H_atyeg","Galbraith, Flynn (A9)","Penna, Matthew W",,"Draft","Penna, Matthew W",,"Galbraith, Flynn (A9)",,"anthony.rollins@delta.com;","stuart.smith@delta.com;brett.valentine@delta.com;","kim.baima@delta.com;bret.martin@delta.com;","matthew.penna@delta.com;","1,647",,"Cloud Foundation","<p></p>","<p></p>","Yes","8/19/2025 7:33 AM","1647","10/31/2025 8:39 AM"

The agent acts as a digital subject matter expert (SME) for the Enterprise Payments domain at Delta Air Lines. PowerAutomate or proprietary UI application will invoke the agent to serve the user queries.

Future scope: Other agents can communicate to this via the A2A protocol by passing the relevant context, prompt and security tokens. 

This intelligent assistant is designed to support a wide range of tasks, including:

1. Answering domain-specific queries related to Enterprise Payments operations.
2. Providing test data for validation and QA purposes in lower environment.
3. Providing pre-defined SQL queries to the user to retrieve relevant data from backend databases.
4. Offering contextual guidance for troubleshooting and analytics.

The Agent serves as a digital SME, streamlining access to complex payment-related information and accelerating decision-making across teams.

About Enterprise Payments at Delta Air Lines:

Enterprise Payments is a critical business domain that handles diverse transaction types across multiple digital and physical channels, including:

1. Delta.com and the Fly Delta app for e-commerce transactions.
2. Flight reservations and ticketing systems.
3. Card-present transactions at airport kiosks (e.g., baggage purchases).

This domain ensures secure, efficient, and scalable processing of payments, supporting Delta’s commitment to seamless customer experiences across its global operations.

Questions:
Its not clear what Agent will be consuming this MCP. Can you update the diagram and request to show what or how users will be interacting with this MCP (Custom Agent/Q CLI/Etc). If its Q CLI then how will you restrict access based on the individual user? 

The consumers can access this agent using API or user tokens via established Delta security patterns as laid out in MCP Security Overview - Delta Cloud Documentation. Centralized authorizer will be leveraged to verify the Ping ID tokens passed in the request to the agent and in the downstream calls (if any).

Also, I saw in the diagram bedrock calling the MCP or the MCP interacting with bedrock. Can you clarify why bedrock access is needed and being used within this MCP.

We have updated the terminology to ‘Agent’ from ‘MCP server’ based on the capabilities and scope of the effort. Bedrock is used here for knowledgebase, summarization and ‘LLM as judge’ pattern to verify the response before passing it to the consumer.
",,"[""Temporary - Pilot""]",,"8/19/2025 12:00 AM",,"Pending",,,,,"Pending","Pending","Pending","Pending","0","1. The Agent does not process or store any PII or PCI data. It is compliant with all GDPR, PSD2 and other mandatory payments compliances and mandates.
2. It is designed to be UI-agnostic, supporting integration with platforms like MS Teams, Delta proprietary applications, Amazon Q, and other LLM ecosystems.
3. The server is owned and maintained solely by the Enterprise Payments team, ensuring domain expertise and operational control.

1.	You should cleanup the references, for example, what MCP stands for...Model Context Protocol.

Ans: Have fixed the accidental typo under the ‘Base Information -> Description’ section.

2.	Can you explain what SDK(s) or frameworks you plan to use? 

Ans: Below are the major SDK(s) or frameworks we are using:

a.	LangGraph: Advanced state-based workflow orchestration with checkpointing and multi-agent coordination
b.	Boto3: AWS SDK for Python, specifically leveraging the Bedrock client for generative AI services
c.	Flask: REST API framework for exposing HTTP endpoints
d.     AWS Strands: For agentic AI framework.

3.	I see your MCP will run on Lambda. I know this is possible, but long-running searches and complex decision logic may be a problem. Could you confirm this or if there would be any other AWS services included? 

Ans: The runtime for workflows which we are planning to use, are well within the limits of the allowed lambda processing times. Below are some more details on the same:
a.	We have identified that workflow step count and prompt template complexity directly impact processing time. We have optimized both to ensure all requests complete well within AWS Lambda runtime limits.
b.	Workflows follow deterministic, pre-defined step sequences using LangGraph StateGraph, enabling predictable runtime estimation and consistent execution paths.
c.	We implemented retry mechanisms with configurable attempts and timeout controls for downstream tool invocations, including automatic token refresh and graceful failure handling to maintain processing time boundaries.
d.	We utilize asynchronous processing patterns, providing immediate acknowledgment to consumers while delivering results via pre-configured callback URLs, ensuring responsive API behavior regardless of workflow complexity.

4.	How do you plan to restrict access for other systems to call this MCP server? ie, from within your account only? Payments are sensitive, so I want to understand how to keep this private (besides the AIP authorizer).

Ans: We will follow the standard Delta patterns for serverless AWS applications. Some of them are mentioned as belows:

a.	We will be using centralized authorizer to allow access only to specific client IDs.
b.	Security groups can be leveraged to allow requests from only designated Delta CIDR ranges.
c.	The lambda is behind a private API Gateway with VPC endpoint policy enforcement. It is exposed by Route53 endpoint in the private Route53 hosted zone, which means it can only be accessed from within the Delta network.
d.	The lambda also lies within a private VPC environment deployed across private subnets in multiple AZs with no internet gateway access.

5. How will you restrict access to the data (i.e. limit the data that's visible to the specific user)? This is typically done by passing the user context to the backend knowledge base, etc.

Ans: In the current scope, we are only loading pre-processed versions of the Enterprise Payment domain knowledge documents in the Bedrock knowledgebase. All documents would undergo data classification review before ingestion. No PII/PCI or other sensitive information would be a part of the knowledgebase. It would not contain any transactional data. Based on the workflow, appropriate meta data will be appended to the prompts to target information extraction from specific documentation.
Only aggregated payments metrics will be pulled from the reporting database (non-pci) to analyze and format with LLM. No direct access for LLM to the metrics. No raw transaction data will be used in the scope of the application.

Restated and below is as provided in email 9/30/2025 11&#58;33pmCT to Brett et al.
The vendor supports SAML 2.0 for their website and has confirmed they will integrate with Global Auth for that experience. Once an employee accesses the site, they are prompted to create an account—consistent with standard practices across most health and welfare benefit platforms.

Minimum 8-character length
Alphanumeric requirement
Periodic password change
No reuse of the last 3 passwords
Lockout after 3 failed login attempts
Self-service password restore capability

For account lifecycle management, unused direct access accounts are disabled. However, former employees may retain access to the vendor’s solution, which is something to note from a governance perspective.

- Dynatrace - Provides application performance monitoring (APM) and error tracking, but lacks AI-powered debugging analysis and detailed 
JavaScript-specific error context
- Quantum Metrics - Focuses on digital experience analytics and session replay, but does not provide code-level error debugging or AI-
assisted root cause analysis

Market Alternatives (not currently in use):
- Sentry - JavaScript error monitoring with basic stack traces, but no AI debugging capabilities
- Rollbar - Error tracking and monitoring, lacks AI-powered analysis
- Bugsnag - Error monitoring platform, no AI debugging features

",,,,"The primary operational risks involve data privacy and AI accuracy. To mitigate data privacy concerns, the AI Debugger automatically filters sensitive information
(IP addresses, usernames) before transmission to OpenAI, operates on an opt-in basis (disabled by default), and is governed by executed Data Processing 
Agreements and Standard Contractual Clauses. OpenAI retains data for a maximum of 30 days before automatic deletion and does not use it for model training. 
Regarding AI accuracy, all debugging recommendations are advisory only and require developer review before implementation, ensuring human oversight of all 
suggested code changes.

Secondary risks include service dependency and compliance concerns, both of which are low-impact. The AI Debugger is an optional enhancement that does not affect core error monitoring functionality. If OpenAI experiences an outage, developers can continue using standard TrackJS error reports for manual debugging. 

Compliance risk is mitigated through TrackJS acting as Data Processor (with our organization remaining Data Controller), clear prohibition on processing sensitive/regulated data, and the ability to disable the feature immediately through account settings without any technical impact or cost.

Overall risk assessment is low. The feature can be disabled instantly if concerns arise, requires no contractual commitment beyond our existing TrackJS agreement,
and provides strong rollback capabilities. We will conduct periodic reviews of AI analysis accuracy, monitor for data privacy incidents, and perform the standard vendor risk assessments to ensure ongoing compliance and risk management.",,,"The AI Debugger requires no formal implementation or rollout plan as it is automatically available within our existing TrackJS subscription. Account 
administrators will enable the feature through account settings, making it immediately accessible to development teams already using TrackJS for error monitoring.
Adoption will be organic and developer-driven  -- when reviewing JavaScript errors in the TrackJS interface, developers can optionally click the AI Debugger tab to 
receive automated root cause analysis and code fix recommendations. We will communicate feature availability through internal development channels and encourage voluntary usage as a debugging assistance tool. Since the feature integrates seamlessly into existing workflows with zero configuration, no training, migration, or dedicated onboarding activities are required.","Mainstream adoption will be driven by demonstrated value and developer experience rather than mandated usage. As early adopters use the AI Debugger and experience faster error resolution, we expect organic adoption through peer recommendations and visible efficiency gains. We will monitor usage patterns and gather developer feedback to assess effectiveness, sharing success stories and best practices through internal development communications. If the tool proves valuable during the initial adoption phase, we may incorporate AI Debugger usage into standard debugging workflows and development best practices documentation. However, given the feature's optional nature and zero incremental cost, there is no pressure for universal adoption; developers will continue using it based on individual preference and situational value, with usage naturally increasing as teams recognize time savings and improved debugging outcomes.","The primary constraint is that customers are prohibited from including sensitive personal data, special categories of data under GDPR, or regulated data (HIPAA, 
PCI-DSS, government identifiers) in error data that may be processed by the AI Debugger. While TrackJS implements automated filtering to remove IP addresses and 
usernames, our organization remains responsible for ensuring compliance with this restriction. Additional constraints include: the AI Debugger is JavaScript-
specific and only analyzes errors captured by TrackJS (not applicable to other programming languages or error sources); data sent to OpenAI is retained for up to 
30 days before deletion; and the feature requires internet connectivity to OpenAI's services in the United States. There are no licensing, user count, or usage 
volume restrictions within our existing TrackJS subscription.","Not applicable as this is an optional capability of a SaaS product.

A rollback and recovery plan ensures minimal disruption in case of failures.",,,"Agentic AI is an integrated UIPath SaaS offering and can be used upon POC Approval",,,"https://git.delta.com/ens/automation/projectautomation/uipathprojects","Summary of POC Use Case

The Cargo Customer Support team faces operational inefficiencies due to high email volume (4,000–5,000 daily) and duplicate case creation from follow-up messages on the same issue. This leads to backlog, missed SLAs, and reduced customer satisfaction. The proposed POC will leverage UiPath Agentic AI to intelligently analyze email intent and context, enabling accurate case categorization, duplicate case linking, and streamlined agent routing. Expected outcomes include improved SLA compliance, faster resolution times, reduced agent workload, and enhanced customer experience—ultimately boosting NPS and brand trust.

This will give the Automation team the opportunity to explore the Agentic AI capability of UIPath and learn how it can be leveraged to improve and create more intelligent automation using LLMs. Recommend this for approval.","10/21/2025 10:43 AM","3 Months","https://deltaairlines-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/joseph_brashear_delta_com/Ecd-TXHLs9ZMuILQ0Ffxm2gBI70mW0G8a07fRe5JQsQo1Q","Riley, Wykita L","Yu, Barry",,"Final Copy","Yu, Barry",,"Riley, Wykita L","12/31/2025 12:00 AM","anthony.rollins@delta.com;","stuart.smith@delta.com;brett.valentine@delta.com;","kim.baima@delta.com;bret.martin@delta.com;","matthew.penna@delta.com;","1,658",,"AI & Automation","<p>Delta Airlines_ SaaSMandateEvidence_UiPath Answered.xlsx (sharepoint.com)</p>","<p>https&#58;//deltaairlines-my.sharepoint.com/&#58;w&#58;/g/personal/pranith_pachlodia00_delta_com/ERMb-8TtTTZPiikzScjuE4IBbrfb_eD_XT4jisrxpvBaFg?e=0rFi9y</p>","Yes","8/25/2025 9:52 PM","1658","10/22/2025 8:36 AM"

I see in the diagram that you are doing a KB from payments SharePoint. You need to clarify why you need to ingest payments SharePoint for this MCP Server - this is an Agent and not an MCP server.
Response : We would be fetching data from ACO SharePoint, it was a copy paste error earlier, I’ve updated the architecture as well.

Why do you need the OpenSearch database in front of the knowledgebase. LLM responses in general aren't very fast so adding in the extra latency on the search vs costs doesn't seem to be worth it here
Response: We have completed the POC with our use case and waiting on the Bedrock access in our account. Post the STR approval with subsequent grant for the Bedrock Access in the ACO AWS account, we will evaluate the options for accessing the knowledgebase by the OpenSearch layer or without it.

It’s not clear how the MCP Server will be interacting with bedrock. From the use case it seems like the Agent interacting with the LLM would be Q CLI or whatever is calling this mcp server

While it integrates with AWS services, it is not a service provided by AWS itself.

The Enterprise AI and CCoE teams are collaborating to develop a suite of Generative AI Patterns on AWS to be consumed across other teams in Delta. These patterns will provide modular, reusable building blocks that can be integrated into their projects without deep AI/ ML expertise.​
The first three patterns that will be developed are as follows:​
Summarization Pattern - To enable users to receive concise summaries of their documents​
Database Chatbot Pattern – To enable users to analyze and query their data in natural language.​
Retrieval-Augmented-Generation Pattern – To enable users to ingest and index enterprise data, enabling LLMs to retrieve and ground responses in Delta-specific knowledge.​

It provides a standardized, model-driven framework for orchestrating AI workflows and multi-agent systems. Without Strands, developers must handcraft orchestration logic or rely on third-party frameworks that are less aligned with AWS. Adopting Strands ensures we use an AWS-native, open-source, and well-supported framework for building agentic applications.
The AI team is building Gen AI solution patterns (Summarization, Database Chatbot, and RAG) that will be provisioned across multiple tenant accounts via AWS Service Catalog. Strands is a good fit for the orchestration layer for the patterns.","Standardization: Establishes a single, AWS-supported framework for agentic AI development.
Future-proofing: Maintains compatibility with Amazon Bedrock and other AWS services.
Faster delivery: Reduces time spent on boilerplate orchestration code.
Cost efficiency: No licensing costs; reduces redundant engineering effort.
Governance: Confidence in long-term support from AWS compared to other third-party solutions.","Agent orchestration: Define and run single or multi-agent GenAI workflows.
Tool integration: Connect agents with APIs, databases, or enterprise systems.
Model flexibility: Works with Bedrock models (Titan, Claude, etc.)
Multi-agent collaboration: Enables complex workflows where multiple agents interact.","The data will be stored and processed within AWS (S3, Dynamo DB etc.)

Additional Info:
The solution would exist entirely in an IBM controlled AWS account.   Although there is a slight depiction of Delta’s network (rightmost box) this is for context only (no changes to Delta’s environment).   We are treating this a SaaS offering from IBM.   Inputs from Delta would be SFTP of source code files.   UI access for the resulting knowledge base would be HTTPS via browser.   I believe a safe number of Delta users would be 2-5.   As stated in the STR this is a PoC.    In the event value is achieved from the PoC we might reconsider expanding the business domains and present another STR for a Delta-controlled AWS account where we would apply the rules you mentioned below as well as amber & emerald mandates as well as submit an updated AI Mandate response.

"KAI - Delta Vacation’s in-house AI Powered Itinerary Planner ","Mishra, Vipin","Mishra, Vipin",,"Business Essential",,,"Delta Vacations","Delta Vacations aims to revolutionize the travel planning experience by integrating an AI-powered conversational trip planning assistant into its digital ecosystem. This innovative feature leverages a custom-trained Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned on Delta's proprietary travel data (packages, pricing, content, policies – similar source as the AI Site Search in Delta.com) to create a natural, intuitive interface for customers to discover, customize, and book their perfect vacations. 

This initiative directly supports Delta's broader strategic pillars: 

Digital transformation by modernizing the booking experience 

Customer-centricity by reducing friction and enhancing personalization 

Competitive differentiation through innovative technology integration 

Revenue optimization by improving conversion and increasing package attachment rates 

The AI trip planner will function as a dynamic, intelligent assistant that understands natural language inputs, maintains conversational context, and guides users through the complex decision-making process of vacation planning. By responding to queries like ""Plan me a beach vacation from Atlanta for a family of four in July under $3,000,"" the system will dramatically simplify the customer journey while creating new opportunities for upselling and cross-selling Delta's full suite of travel products.

Pending item: PIA","Yes","vipin.mishra@delta.com","Yes","COTS / Licensed","[""Yes""]","IaaS","No",,"Plug Ins",,,,,"Yes","Customer Challenges 

Complexity Overload: Travel planning involves numerous interconnected decisions (destinations, dates, accommodations, activities, transportation) that create cognitive burden and decision paralysis for customers. 

Information Fragmentation: Users currently must navigate multiple sections of the website to piece together trip components, leading to frustration and abandoned sessions. 

Personalization Gap: The current experience requires extensive manual filtering and browsing to find options that match specific preferences and constraints. 

Confidence Deficit: Customers often struggle to validate whether their selections align with their needs, potentially leading to post-booking regret. 

 
Business Challenges 

Conversion Friction: The existing multi-step booking funnel creates numerous drop-off points, with only 2.3% of sessions resulting in completed bookings. 

Limited Cross-Selling: Current package attachment rates hover at 15%, below industry benchmarks of 22-25%. 

Underutilized Inventory: Approximately 35% of available inventory fails to convert, particularly for non-peak seasons and emerging destinations. 

Support Burden: 47% of customer support calls relate to pre-booking research questions that could be handled by an intelligent assistant. 

Competitive Pressure: Major OTAs are already deploying AI assistants, threatening Delta's direct booking share. 

 
The AI-powered trip planning experience addresses these challenges by providing a unified, conversational interface that simplifies decision-making, delivers personalized recommendations, and creates a more engaging, confidence-building booking journey. ","Core benefit: Replace Delta Vacation’s fragmented 7-page booking flow with a single, AI-driven conversational surface that dramatically lowers cognitive load and decision friction — speeding time-to-decision, raising conversion and attach rates, and creating a more personalized, loyalty-building experience. 
 
CX Improvement:  

Fewer steps, less friction: Users move from clicking through seven separate pages (search → options → extras → seats → payment, etc.) to a single multi-turn conversation that surfaces only what matters, when it matters. 

Preserved context & memory: Multi-turn chat keeps prior answers in context (dates, budget, preferences), so customers aren’t forced to re-enter info across pages. 

Guided decisioning vs choice overload: The assistant synthesizes options and explains tradeoffs (price vs. convenience) — preventing paralysis that causes abandonment in long multi-page funnels. 

Faster, mobile-native interaction: Conversational flow maps naturally to mobile screens (reducing form fatigue and page loads), improving completion on mobile where multi-page funnels lose users. 

Real-time personalization & prefill: SkyMiles/profile data and CDP signals auto-prefill relevant defaults (class, loyalty upgrades), reducing manual steps and increasing trust. 

Easy modifications & reversibility: Instead of re-navigating pages to edit a booking, users ask a simple request (“add snorkeling, remove spa”) and get an immediate, contextual update. 

 
Direct business impact (linked to KPIs) 

Higher conversions: Removing multi-page drop-offs and simplifying the path supports the targeted +30% uplift in conversion. 

Shorter sessions → faster decisions: Replacing page-hops with chat helps achieve the −20 to −30% session duration reduction target (quicker path to purchase). 

Greater attach & AOV: Contextual, in-flow upsells increase package/ancillary attach rates (+27–53%) and Average Booking Value (+10–20%). 

Lower support & operational costs: Self-service in the conversation reduces pre-booking calls (−20 to −40%), lowering contact center spend. 

Stronger brand & retention: A simpler, more human planning experience drives NPS gains (+6 to +13), feeding higher repeat purchase/LTV. 

Customer outcomes (short) 

Faster planning, less frustration, clearer choices. 

Perceived personalization and trust through prefilled preferences and transparent rationale. 

One coherent journey from inspiration → itinerary → booking (shareable and modifiable). ","onversational Trip Planning

S1  End-to-End Encryption - All data in transit and at rest must be encrypted, in compliance with our policies. This applies to data within the SaaS platform, and the integration or access to Delta systems.  &lt; Please specify how data will be encrypted on your end, at rest and in transit&gt;

All access to all applications on causaLens platform is end-to-end encrypted with HTTPS. Any access to your S3 bucket is also encrypted via HTTPS. We do not intend to store any other data at rest.

S2.A&#58; All Delta users must be authenticated by Global Auth, including MFA if required by Delta security standards. This requires a federated authentication integration with the SaaS provider. &lt; Please state that any of the UI applications you provide will be integrated with Delta Global Identity &gt;

Yes we will integrate our authentication gateway (login.causalens.com) with your IDP such that all Delta users will be using Delta's IDP and Delta's MFA policies.

S4  Logging - The SaaS provider must offer logging or a way to view events for important transactions (e.g. logins, high-value transactions, administrative changes, etc.)  
&lt; Please state how observability will be available to Delta &gt;

Platform already offers the ability to view logs of all applications running on it, including a UI log browser.

S5  Restrict Network Access - The Delta tenant of the SaaS solution must only be accessible from the Delta network unless there is a business requirement to allow access from the public Internet. &lt; Please state what network guidelines are in place so that only Delta CIDRs are allowed &gt;

Being a multitenanted platform, this is not easily possible given that it would necessitate dedicated infrastructure to support. In this case I would suggest a requirement for causaLens and Delta staff to work on the data together as a sufficient requirement to waive this condition.


- the cloud platform operates upon K8S&#58; instances of tenant's applications, or research tools such as jupyter notebook are separate instances launched on the same k8s cluster
- instances for different customers (and within customers, different &quot;workspaces&quot; as we call them) are placed into a separate kubernetes namespaces, and therefore achieve a network boundary between them too. That means that instances from 2 different customers will always be in different namespaces and have a network boundary.
- the instances running on k8s mount a cluster-wide elastic file system (NFS) but are limited to mounting different directories (called file stores on our platform). The association of file stores &lt;-&gt; customer workspaces is made through logical association on basis of customer-file store permission tables
- each instance runs an HTTPS endpoint and is gated with SSO and controls who has access to the instance on the basis of a group claim in OIDC
- each user is assigned to groups. Typically customers have their own group, or customer may map to multiple groups when dealing with multiple projects across an organization. But it is never the case that a single group is shared between two customers

</p>","<p>
- underlying LLM infrastructure (the models) is shared, but runs in inference mode only (see below)
- No, we strictly do no training upon customer data, nor make it available to anyone
- LLMs run in purely inference mode, that means that their weights are not being updated by the requests that pass through a common gateway. Inference mode means that LLM models are immutable / static, they do not learn/update as they see more data.</p>","Yes","9/15/2025 6:27 AM","1707","11/6/2025 10:05 AM"

Technology Solution Overview:

Delta Air Lines proposes to implement a proof of concept integration with Palantir Foundry, a data analytics and decision support platform, to address critical operational visibility gaps in crew change management during irregular operations (IROPs).

Technical Architecture: The solution involves deploying Palantir Foundry connectors within Delta's AWS environment to establish secure, direct data feeds from five internal IT systems: Crew Management (Crew IT), Flight Operations, TechOps (aircraft maintenance), Airport Customer Services (ACS), and external airport curfew databases. Data flows through encrypted channels without intermediate storage in Delta AWS, connecting directly to Palantir's cloud-hosted analytics platform.

Functional Capabilities: The system will analyze real-time operational data to predict cascading effects of crew reassignments on subsequent flight operations. It will classify crew changes as ""good breaks"" (minimal downstream impact) or ""bad breaks"" (significant cascading disruptions), enabling Operations Control Center personnel to make informed decisions during irregular operations and minimize network-wide disruptions.

Technology Stack:

Palantir Foundry (SaaS analytics platform)
AWS-hosted integration layer with IAM, encryption, and audit controls
Direct API integrations with existing Delta IT systems

Business Drivers: Delta's Operations Control Center (OCC) currently operates with a critical blind spot during irregular operations (IROPs) - the inability to assess cascading impacts of crew reassignments on downstream flight operations. This gap forces operational decisions to be made reactively rather than proactively, often resulting in:

Unintended cascading delays that compound throughout the network
Increased customer disruption and compensation costs
Suboptimal resource utilization during recovery operations
Extended recovery times from irregular operations
Reduced operational efficiency and on-time performance metrics
Technical Limitations of Current State: Our existing systems operate in silos, lacking the integrated analytical capability to model complex interdependencies between crew assignments, aircraft positioning, gate availability, airport constraints, and maintenance requirements. Current crew management tools can identify available crew but cannot predict the operational ripple effects of reassignment decisions across the network.

Strategic Business Value: Implementing predictive crew change impact analysis will enable:

Proactive IROP management with data-driven decision making
Reduced network disruption through ""good break"" identification
Improved customer experience through minimized cascading delays
Enhanced operational resilience and faster recovery times
Competitive advantage in operational reliability metrics
Technical Requirements: The solution requires real-time integration of disparate operational data sources with advanced analytics capabilities that exceed our current internal technical capacity. Palantir Foundry provides the necessary machine learning algorithms, data integration platform, and analytical processing power to deliver actionable insights within the time-critical decision windows required during irregular operations.

Risk Mitigation: Without this capability, Delta continues to operate with reactive crew management during IROPs, increasing the risk of network-wide disruptions that impact thousands of passengers and generate significant operational costs.","Business Benefits and Return on Investment:

Quantifiable Cost Savings:

Reduced Passenger Compensation: Minimizing cascading delays decreases denied boarding compensation, meal vouchers, and hotel accommodations. Estimated savings of $2-5M annually based on 15-25% reduction in IROP-related passenger disruptions.
Crew Overtime Reduction: Better crew positioning reduces premium pay for out-of-position crews and last-minute crew scheduling. Projected savings of $1-3M annually through optimized crew utilization.
Aircraft Repositioning Costs: Preventing ""bad breaks"" reduces need for costly aircraft ferrying and repositioning flights. Estimated $500K-1.5M annual savings.
Operational Recovery Time: Faster IROP recovery reduces extended operational costs including ground handling, gate fees, and fuel inefficiencies. Projected $1-2M annual savings.
Revenue Protection:

Customer Retention: Improved operational reliability protects revenue from customer defection due to poor service experience. Estimated $5-10M annual revenue protection.
Premium Pricing Maintenance: Operational excellence supports Delta's premium positioning and pricing power in the market.
Operational Efficiency Gains:

OCC Productivity: Reduced decision-making time and improved accuracy enables OCC staff to handle higher volumes of irregular operations with existing headcount.
Network Resilience: Enhanced ability to contain disruptions prevents system-wide impacts that historically require days to fully recover.
Strategic Value:

Competitive Differentiation: Superior operational reliability during weather events and system disruptions provides measurable competitive advantage.
Scalability: Analytics platform provides foundation for expanding predictive capabilities to other operational domains.
Investment and ROI:

Proof of Concept Cost: $0 (provided at no cost by Palantir)
Internal Resource Investment: Minimal - leveraging existing IT infrastructure and personnel
Total Estimated Annual Benefit: $10-22M in combined cost savings and revenue protection
ROI: Immediate positive return with no upfront capital investment required for proof of concept
Risk Mitigation Value: Prevents potential multi-million dollar operational meltdowns during major weather events or system failures that historically cost $20-50M in recovery expenses and customer compensation.","Core Business Capabilities:

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Architect Analysis & Recommendations

Prepared by: Manonmani, Chellakumar Mark Robinson (Robin), IT Portfolio Architect, Delta Air Lines

Executive Summary: This POC request emerges from business-driven conversations between Delta IT and OCC teams who engaged directly with Palantir. During these discussions, Palantir positioned their platform as uniquely capable of solving Delta's data silos challenges, citing the 2024 CrowdStrike outage that disrupted Delta operations for five days as an example of problems their platform could have mitigated.

Technical Assessment: From an architectural perspective, the selected crew change impact analysis use case represents a well-defined operational analytics problem that falls within the capabilities of Delta's existing AWS ecosystem. The use case does not leverage Palantir's acclaimed Ontology framework—often cited as their differentiating technology—to its full potential, suggesting the problem scope may not require Palantir's specialized capabilities.

Alternative Solution Viability: A thorough comparative analysis indicates that AWS-native services (SageMaker, Glue, QuickSight, Lambda) could theoretically deliver equivalent functionality. However, this would require significant development investment, specialized talent acquisition, and 12-18 months of development time that Delta IT currently lacks the bandwidth to pursue.

Strategic Considerations: While the technical merits favor an AWS-native approach for long-term architectural consistency, several business factors support proceeding with the Palantir POC:

Risk Mitigation: The estimated $10-22M annual cost of operational inefficiencies justifies rapid solution deployment
Resource Constraints: Delta IT's current capacity limitations make immediate internal development impractical
Executive Alignment: Strong executive sponsorship provides necessary organizational support for rapid implementation
Validation Opportunity: The free POC serves as valuable requirements gathering for future AWS-native development
Recommendation: Approve the Palantir POC with the explicit understanding that success should trigger immediate evaluation of AWS-native alternatives for production implementation. This approach provides immediate business value while maintaining Delta's strategic architectural direction and allows proper validation of Palantir's claims regarding data integration capabilities.

Risk Mitigation: Establish clear POC success criteria and exit strategy to prevent vendor lock-in while capturing maximum learning value for future internal development efforts.","10/2/2025 9:07 AM","6 weeks","https://deltaairlines-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/joseph_brashear_delta_com/ESV83qy2UyxCiG87WE9DT_gBXTYxSJoYWMyKCbHR6NdwTQ",,"Manonmani, Chellakumar","[""Temporary - POC""]","Final Copy","Manonmani, Chellakumar",,"Winters, Thomas (A9)","10/31/2025 12:00 AM","anthony.rollins@delta.com;","stuart.smith@delta.com;brett.valentine@delta.com;","kim.baima@delta.com;bret.martin@delta.com;","matthew.penna@delta.com;","1,714","An SLT decision has been made not to use Palantir outside of TechOps.",,"<p></p>","<p></p>","Yes","9/18/2025 4:08 PM","1714","10/2/2025 9:08 AM"

It also supports resource and capacity planning by providing visibility into team workloads, helping managers allocate resources effectively. With built-in dashboards and reporting tools, businesses can visualize key metrics and make data-driven decisions. Monday.com extends its functionality to CRM and sales pipeline management, time tracking, document management, and even custom app development through its open API and integration capabilities. These features make it a versatile solution for aligning departments, improving productivity, and scaling operations across the organization. ","​​Monday.com stores and processes customer data using the Vendor Hosted Cloud Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure, with data centers located in multiple global regions to support performance, compliance, and data residency requirements. By default, most customer data is hosted in the United States, specifically in the AWS Northern Virginia region. However, Monday.com also offers data residency options in the European Union for enterprise customers and for certain users who signed up after January 2023, ensuring compliance with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Some accounts in the Asia-Pacific region may also be hosted locally, although Japanese accounts are typically hosted in the U.S. All data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, and Monday.com adheres to strict security standards, including SOC 2 Type II, ISO/IEC 27001, and HIPAA. This infrastructure ensures that customer data is handled securely and in accordance with regional compliance requirements.​ ","Monday.com has several comparable alternatives that organizations like Delta Air Lines may already use or have approved. Tools such as Microsoft Project and Microsoft Planner are commonly adopted in enterprise environments due to their deep integration with Microsoft 365 and robust project planning features. Smartsheet is another strong alternative, offering a spreadsheet-like interface with powerful automation and reporting capabilities, often favored for its flexibility and compliance readiness. Asana and ClickUp provide intuitive task and workflow management, while Wrike excels in project portfolio management and resource planning. Other options like Airtable and Trello offer more lightweight, visual approaches to task tracking, and Notion combines documentation with task management for knowledge-centric teams. For enterprise-grade needs, Adobe Workfront and ServiceNow are often used for managing complex workflows, particularly in marketing, IT, and operations. These tools offer varying levels of customization, scalability, and integration, making them viable alternatives depending on the specific needs and existing infrastructure of the organization.

"Sprih","Jenkins, Alexandra","Jenkins, Alexandra",,"Business","Sprih","New","Supply Chain","The Sprih Tool is a SaaS-based solution that automates and enhances emissions reporting across Scopes 1, 2, and 3, aligning with global sustainability standards. It consolidates data from multiple sources into a single, secure platform, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy.

Scope 1: Direct emissions from Delta’s operations (e.g., fuel combustion in aircraft and ground equipment).
Scope 2: Indirect emissions from purchased energy (e.g., electricity from utilities using fossil fuels).
Scope 3: All other indirect emissions, primarily from the supply chain (e.g., goods and services purchased). Suppliers’ Scope 1 and 2 emissions roll up into Delta’s Scope 3 category.

Current Challenge: Delta currently reports all three scopes annually in its ESG report. While Scopes 1 and 2 are managed by Sustainability and Fuel/SAF teams, Scope 3 reporting is manual and resource-intensive, requiring vendor spend categorization, manual application of EPA emission factors, and maintenance of a custom dashboard.

By automating emissions reporting and providing actionable insights, the Sprih Tool:
-Reduces manual workload and operational risk.
-Improves data quality and completeness.
-Strengthens Delta’s ability to meet sustainability goals and regulatory requirements.
-Positions Delta to lead in supplier engagement and climate risk mitigation.

Today, this process is fragmented and highly manual, relying on multiple teams and disparate data sources. The new tool addresses these challenges by automating data collection from publicly available supplier reports, applying standardized calculations, and engaging suppliers only when additional details are required. This streamlined approach improves data accuracy, reduces operational effort, and ensures timely, audit-ready reporting—making it a critical component of Delta’s supply chain sustainability strategy.","Sprih streamlines and strengthens Delta’s supply chain emissions reporting by automating data collection and improving accuracy—particularly for Scope 3 emissions, which are the most complex to measure.
(Scope 3: All other indirect emissions, primarily from the supply chain (e.g., goods and services purchased). Suppliers’ Scope 1 and 2 emissions roll up into Delta’s Scope 3 category)
-Efficiency: Eliminates manual data gathering by automatically pulling supplier-specific metrics from ESG reports and applying spend-based methodology for others.
Comprehensive Coverage: Delivers full Scope 3 visibility across top ~300 vendors and beyond.
-Data Quality & Audit Readiness: Enhances accuracy and includes third-party verification for compliance confidence.
-Secure & Integrated: Uses SSO for secure access and ensures spend data is uploaded through the Sprih platform, not email.
-Strategic Impact: Provides actionable insights to engage suppliers on sustainability, reduce climate risk, and support Delta’s environmental commitments.","This SaaS-based solution provides a comprehensive platform for emissions measurement and sustainability insights, designed to align with global reporting standards.
Core Capabilities:

As Brett suggested that before we go ahead with this STR, work with Indu's team for the summarization use cases. Business worked with them and after working with Indu's team for about 2-3 weeks below are the findings and business email:

Hi Shashank,
Following up on our discussion after today's meeting with the AI team regarding the case summarization pattern.

The AI team encountered issues publishing the summary pattern to the catalog, so they're moving forward with an alternative approach: packaging the resources in their account and replicating them into ours.

Could you please submit the STR for this project? The STR should include:

The AI team's packaged architecture design
Resource replication plan from their AWS account to our account
Even though we're not using the catalog deployment method, we still need the STR approved before the AI team can replicate their resources into our environment and we can begin processing wellness cases.

Please let me know if you need any additional information from me or if you'd like to schedule a brief call to discuss the architecture details before submitting.

Thanks,
 
AJ FREEMAN
Manager, Data Infrastructure
Health Analytics & Innovation

Can we have the approval as soon as possible because business is waiting on this more than a month now.

Technically, Bedrock integrates seamlessly with the existing AWS infrastructure, including Redshift Serverless for data access. The serverless architecture provides cost-effective scaling without model hosting overhead, while automated processing of both open and closed cases maintains comprehensive, up-to-date documentation that improves case visibility and decision-making for support teams.  ","The automated case summary system delivers measurable ROI through significant labor cost savings by eliminating manual documentation tasks that typically require 15-30 minutes per case. With processing capabilities of hundreds of cases per batch, the system can save thousands of hours annually in manual effort, translating to substantial cost reductions in operational overhead. Beyond direct labor savings, the solution improves case resolution times by providing consistent, comprehensive summaries that enable faster knowledge transfer and decision-making. The multi-model approach ensures high-quality documentation that reduces case escalations and repeat inquiries, further driving down support costs. The serverless AWS architecture minimizes infrastructure costs while providing scalable processing capacity that grows with business needs, making the solution cost-effective from both operational and technical perspectives. ","The program will use Bedrock to Automatically generates comprehensive summaries for open cases and closed cases without recent documentation

Technical Architecture Assessment
Strengths
AWS-Native Integration: Excellent leverage of existing Redshift Serverless infrastructure with direct Bedrock integration. Minimal architectural complexity with clear data flow from case retrieval to summary storage.
Focused Model Selection: Claude Sonnet provides optimal balance of quality and cost for case summarization without unnecessary multi-model complexity.
Serverless Architecture: No infrastructure management overhead, automatic scaling, and pay-per-use cost model aligns with operational efficiency goals.

Labor Cost Reduction: Eliminates 15-30 minutes of manual documentation per case
Consistency: Standardized summary format and quality across all cases
Scalability: Handles varying case volumes without operational overhead

Technical Risks (Low): Single model dependency, basic error handling

This enables the enterprise to take targeted action—whether through policy changes, process improvements, or technology enhancements—to prevent unnecessary volume from reaching RES. By equipping teams with actionable insights, this upgrade directly supports strategic cost reduction, operational efficiency, and enterprise-wide accountability.","The key capability introduced in this release is Topic AI Studio (TAS), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically identify and categorize customer contact intents with greater granularity and accuracy. TAS not only surfaces Level 3 intents but also detects discrete agent actions (e.g., “Collect billing information”), enabling a deeper understanding of both customer needs and agent behavior.
This enhanced capability allows for more precise root cause analysis, accelerates the identification of emerging volume drivers, and supports targeted operational improvements. By automating what was previously a manual and time-consuming process, TAS empowers RES and enterprise teams to act faster and more effectively on insights.","CTR and audio data are securely pushed to a designated S3 bucket, where the NiCE platform ingests it into their processing ecosystem. Each morning, NiCE returns processed DEU files to a Delta-owned S3 bucket, enabling seamless ingestion back into our Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW).","While Netomi and Qualtrics offer products with some overlapping capabilities, neither company has the same deep call center expertise that NiCE possesses.
Additionally, implementing either alternative would require significant time, resources, and customization to integrate with RES systems—posing operational and financial barriers that make them impractical in our current context. In contrast, the proposed solution delivers immediate value with minimal lift.","An alternative approach would be to engage additional consulting resources from NiCE to manually perform call listening and analysis. This method would be significantly more tedious, slow, and resource-intensive—costing hundreds of thousands to potentially millions of dollars annually.
Beyond the financial burden, manual call listening lacks scalability and timeliness, making it impractical for identifying emerging volume drivers or supporting agile decision-making. In contrast, the proposed upgrade automates this process using AI, delivering faster, more accurate insights at a fraction of the cost and effort—while enabling RES to meet enterprise expectations for accountability and impact.","There is no incremental cost to upgrade.

While Copilot in Bing features general functionality, the legal field requires a specialized tool featuring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other fine-tuning based on legal training data.  RAG is a technique which improves AI models by having them retrieve information from an external knowledge base before generating a response.
 
These tools have specialized functionality, such as: 
 
1.	General purpose conversational chatbots, like ChatGPT or Copilot in Bing, but specifically trained for the legal function; and 
2.	Legal productivity tool: perform first pass contract review (redlining) and write a brief for a litigator

Harvey.ai is a cloud-native solution hosted on Microsoft Azure and can integrate with MFA via SAML 2.0 or Oauth, supporting enterprise identity providers like Azure AD.

Also, the Law Department will be using the Harvey for Word, Harvey for Outlook, and Harvey for Sharepoint/OneDrive  Add-Ins during the pilot, for a more enriching experience.  These add-ins are available for download in the Microsoft App Store.  I have included security and data privacy information for the add-ins in the Data Residency section of this STR.

1.	General purpose conversational chatbots, like ChatGPT or Copilot in Bing, but specifically trained for the legal function; and
2.	Legal productivity tool: perform first pass contract review (redlining) and write a brief for a litigator

To evaluate the effectiveness of CoCounsel, Harvey AI, and GC AI, Delta’s Law Department will measure success across four key dimensions: (1) task efficiency, (2) output quality<checking for correctness/completeness/grounding to sources/hallucinations through human verification of output by frequent spot-checking and confirmation during the pilot> , (3) ease of user adoption, and (4) productivity enablement. Each tool will be tested against high-impact legal workflows such as first-pass contract review, clause extraction, legal research, and litigation brief drafting. 
(1)	Efficiency will be measured by the anecdotal reduction in turnaround time for these tasks, with a target of at least 30% anecdotal improvement overline baseline. 
(2)	Output quality will be assessed through pilot participant review, with particular consideration of correctness and alignment with internal standards.
(3)	User adoption will be anecdotally tracked through usage frequency, repeat engagement, and satisfaction scores. 
(4)	Productivity enablement will focus on how well each tool supports scalable legal support, reduces manual effort, and enhances transparency in legal reasoning. 
The vendor that demonstrates the strongest alignment with legal workflows, delivers measurable efficiency gains, and earns the highest user confidence will be selected for broader implementation. This approach ensures the chosen solution not only meets technical expectations but also empowers legal teams to operate with greater agility, compliance, and innovation.

","The Delta Law Department is exploring the adoption of an AI-powered cloud-based legal technology platform to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and support strategic legal initiatives. These tools are designed to automate high-volume, low-complexity legal tasks—such as contract review, document drafting, and legal research—thereby freeing attorneys to focus on higher-value advisory and risk management work.

By accelerating legal workflows and minimizing manual review time, such platforms can help optimize internal legal bandwidth, reduce reliance on outside counsel, and improve turnaround times. This aligns with Delta’s broader enterprise goals of innovation, agility, and cost efficiency.

AI legal tools built for enterprise use typically deliver professional-grade outputs with minimal prompting, enabling consistent and scalable support across transactional and litigation matters. Industry benchmarks suggest that organizations implementing these solutions can achieve:

•	20–40% reduction in time spent on routine legal tasks
•	10–30% decrease in outside counsel spend
•	Faster contract cycle times and improved compliance consistency

These benefits translate into measurable ROI while also enhancing the legal department’s ability to respond quickly to business needs.

Unlike general-purpose AI tools, legal-specific platforms are designed to prioritize accuracy, traceability, and explainability, context sensitivity, and domain relevance. This is critical in minimizing the risk of “hallucinations”—instances where AI generates plausible but incorrect or misleading information—which can have serious implications in legal contexts. A tool that understands legal language, structure, and standards helps ensure that outputs are not only efficient but also reliable, reducing the risk of reputational, regulatory, or financial exposure
","This solution offers two core capabilities tailored to the legal function:

•	Specialized Legal Chatbot (Use Case #1)
A domain-trained AI assistant that can interpret and respond to complex legal queries, summarize documents, extract key clauses, and assist with legal research. It enables attorneys to interact with large volumes of legal data conversationally, improving speed, accuracy, and decision-making.

•	Legal Productivity Tools (Use Case #2)
Includes advanced contract redlining and clause comparison features that automate first-pass reviews, flag deviations from standard terms, and suggest revisions. These tools significantly reduce manual effort, enhance consistency, and accelerate contract turnaround times. In addition, this use case includes rapid context-aware legal research and generates first drafts of litigation documents, memos, and correspondence, helping attorneys move faster while maintaining quality.

Together, these capabilities help legal teams work smarter and faster—reducing bottlenecks, improving quality, and enabling scalable legal support across the enterprise
","The data storage location is within the MS Azure infrastructure, on the east coast. The fallback location is in Washington state.  The same is true for data processing.  All data stays in the US.  There are 3 options for data storage: multi tenant, logically separated; dedicated storage (happy medium) and pick region, or custom-managed keys.  This application offers configurable data retention periods.  Data deletion can be set from no retention to indefinite retention.  This application is GDPR compliant.

Harvey.AI does not use MCP servers.

Regarding the Harvey for Word add-in:
The Harvey Word Add-In allows users to modify Word documents by editing existing text or adding new content. Suggestions can be generated through user prompts or by analyzing uploaded precedents to identify relevant clauses.

The add-in follows the same stringent security and data privacy standards as the Harvey web application, including ISO 27001 certification and SOC 2 Type II compliance.

Harvey's Word Add-In is a web-based extension built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages Harvey’s secure platform infrastructure for processing.  Harvey's Word Add-In only accesses the content in the document the user currently has open. It cannot access other documents on the user's device, or other files owned by their company or colleagues within Microsoft 365.

When making revisions: The add-in processes only the text explicitly highlighted by the user and any content uploaded as precedent.
When drafting new content: Harvey looks at 50 characters before and after the cursor, to provide context for formatting and language, though it's limited to examining the current paragraph only. Access to the document ends when the document is closed or the add-in is exited. Users must activate the Word Add-In separately for each document they wish to use Harvey with.  The Add-In utilizes the same infrastructure as Harvey’s web application.

The Add-In applies the same encryption standards as the Harvey web application:
Data in Transit: Secured using HTTPS and TLS 1.2 or higher to ensure protection during transmission.
Data at Rest: Encrypted with AES-256 or higher, providing strong security for stored data.
The Harvey Word Add-In uses the same authentication method configured for your Harvey workspace. Users log in with their Harvey credentials, including single sign-on (SSO) via SAML.  To access the Add-In, users must also have specific permissions granted by the Delta administrators to manage Add-In permissions directly through the Harvey web application.  All activity within the Harvey Word Add-In is visible to your organization’s Harvey administrators through the Workspace History and Usage dashboards.  Additionally, this activity is streamed to the History and Audit Log API endpoints, enabling programmatic tracking and integration with Delta's internal systems.  the Word Add-In will be deployed using Radia

Regarding the Harvey for Outlook Add-In:
Harvey for Outlook lets you access Harvey Assistant directly within an email thread. You can generate answers by asking open-ended questions or by uploading precedent documents from your desktop or Vault (Vault is a collaborative workspace for large-scale document review, analysis, and synthesis).

Harvey for Outlook only has access to the currently open email thread. It does not scan your entire inbox or any other part of Outlook. Harvey does not automatically read your emails; it only has context of the current thread when you hit “Ask”.

When asking questions: Harvey uses the context of the open thread and its attachments.
When saving to Vault: Harvey will save the current email thread and its attachments to Vault.
Once the thread is closed or Harvey for Outlook is exited, access to that email ends.  

Harvey for Outlook utilizes the same infrastructure as Harvey’s web application for processing data. Harvey for Outlook maintains the same encryption standards as the Harvey web application:

Data in transit: Secured using HTTPS and TLS 1.2 or higher to ensure protection during transmission.
Data at rest: Encrypted with AES-256 or higher, providing strong security for stored data.

Authentication is the same as your Harvey workspace:

Users log in with their Harvey credentials, including single sign-on (SSO) via SAML (if enabled).
Access also requires Add-In permissions granted by Harvey, even after downloading it. Admins should work with their Harvey Customer Success Manager to designate which team members should have access. 

Harvey for Sharepoint/OneDrive:
Users are able to find and upload SharePoint files directly in the Harvey App using a standard OAuth flow.  Harvey for SharePoint uses delegated access (Mike Ramirez said this is possible) to interact with Microsoft Graph API on behalf of a user, meaning it requires both the application and the user to have the necessary permissions. Admin users can access the ""Integrations"" section in the Harvey App Settings panel to manage workspace integrations.  Once an admin enables an integration, all users in that workspace will see “Upload from SharePoint/OneDriveˮ buttons in Assistant.  When an integration is disabled, all user access tokens for that integration will be cleared from the workspace. This is to ensure that Harvey doesnʼt have access to the customerʼs DMS once the integration is disabled. Additionally, users will need to re-authenticate and reconnect their Harvey accounts if and when the integration is re-enabled. Also, when an integration is disabled, files previously uploaded via the integration will remain in Harvey and just follow the workspace's standard data retention policies. 

The Harvey SharePoint integration utilizes Microsoftʼs OAuth 2.0 protocol for secure and authorized access to SharePoint resources. OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard authorization framework that allows applications like Harvey to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. 

All files uploaded from SharePoint will also follow your workspace's existing standard data retention policies. Documents uploaded from SharePoint are stored securely within Harvey's infrastructure, adhering to our strict data protection standards. The Harvey SharePoint integration maintains the same robust security and infrastructure protocols as the core Harvey app, ensuring all existing security measures, infrastructure, and data protection standards remain intact.

The FAM (Flight Advisory Message) Timeliness Queue is used to analyze when late arriving equipment problems occur and how long it takes OCC SOMs to solution the problem by issuing an ETD FAM or aircraft swap. This dataset also shows how the effective turn time of a flight changes over time and can be analyzed to find improvements to make ETD FAMs more accurate and timely after the problem is first flagged. Timely advisories allow flight crews and ground operations to adjust plans quickly and keeps customers accurately informed on the status of their flight. 
The current FAM Timeliness Queue is provided by a view in dwprod but will have decreasing performance over time since it queries and joins inbound and outbound flights dating back to 2023. Access to S3 tables will allow for a seamless flow of data through an ETL on AWS that will maintain a permanent data store for the FAM Timeliness Queue in dwprod. 

crew-ai Current Use Case: 
We have data services that run continuously to fetch tc-engine, pilot supply, open time and reserves by day. These services fetch the near real time data that needs to be saved as snapshots on each run. The results from each run require querying at a given point in time for analytics and time travel. The current process of converting time series data in pseudo temporal data requires significant undertaking and logic that can be simplified through S3 tables. Since S3 Tables provide in-built iceberg support to auto capture snapshots, we can pair this with Athena for time travel and point in time queries to visualize in BI tools such as quicksight. 

 ","Whitelisting S3 Tables would allow Data Engineers an easy way to create, maintain, and store Apache Iceberg tables. This would increase efficiency on projects that could benefit from using an Iceberg table by reducing the amount of ongoing effort need to create automated maintenance processes of manually maintain Iceberg tables stored in AWS.  
Iceberg tables increase performance by allowing maintenance operations, so table read speed does not decrease over time. Iceberg tables also allow for time travel to retrieve valid records from different valid states of a table enabling the storage of pseudo temporal data in an accessible AWS table. 

 ","Create and maintain Apache Iceberg tables without managing additional maintenance operations like vacuuming and compaction. Apache Iceberg allows for snapshot time travel and optimized performance by removing expired records. 
S3 tables provide optimized storage for analytics workload by combining the benefits of the Apache Iceberg open table format and ease of use of S3 buckets with an Athena connection. S3 tables can be configured to automatically run maintenance operations on Iceberg tables including vacuuming, snapshot expiry, and compaction.

Re: Note regarding not integrating with Global Authentication.
The content shared during the virtual open enrollment fairs is considered Internal, but HR has confirmed it is not sensitive or restricted in a way that would require breach reporting if viewed externally. While we don’t advertise it publicly, the information—primarily plan details—is widely shared with employees, spouses, and adult dependents, and is even made available to candidates during pre-hire stages.

Because of this broad audience, the sessions are handled in a semi-public manner, and Global Auth integration was not implemented as the user experience can’t be managed for Spouses and Adult Dependents that need this information. HR emphasized that ensuring access to this information is a priority, which is why authentication is not enforced.

Lightspeed is purpose-built for infrastructure automation teams using Ansible. It’s deeply integrated with Red Hat’s Ansible Automation Platform and offers:
•	Natural language to Ansible Playbook generation, including multi-task and role creation.
•	Content source matching and post-processing, ensuring generated code aligns with best practices.
•	Explainability features help users understand the logic behind generated tasks.
•	AI Transparency, Lightspeeds’ “training matches” tab links every suggestion to source code, license, and author.
•	Human-centered workflow, Lightspeed’s AI provides suggestions, human validates.
 
In contrast, Amazon Q CLI is a general-purpose developer tool focused on broader software development tasks. While it supports natural language command generation and code reviews across multiple languages (Java, Python, etc.), it’s not tailored for Ansible or infrastructure automation workflows. It’s more suited for CLI-heavy development environments, AWS-integrated pipelines, and doesn’t provide the same AI transparency or human-centered workflow capabilities as Lightspeed.

AWS Quick Suite offers a set of generative AI-powered capabilities that enable natural language interaction with enterprise data, including diagrams, org charts, domain models, and architecture artifacts.
As a Portfolio Architect, I intend to use AWS Quick Suite to:

-Field architecture-related questions from stakeholders across the enterprise using conversational AI.
-Interact with complex EA artifacts (e.g., organizational charts, capability maps, solution diagrams) through natural language queries.
-Accelerate decision-making by enabling real-time access to architecture insights without manual navigation of documentation.
-Improve cross-domain visibility by surfacing relationships and dependencies across business, application, and technology domains.
-Support value stream alignment by enabling queries that connect enabler capabilities to strategic outcomes.

Value to the Organization:

-Enhanced productivity for architecture and strategy teams by reducing time spent searching, interpreting, and explaining EA artifacts.
-Improved stakeholder engagement through intuitive access to architecture knowledge, fostering better collaboration and understanding.
-Scalable knowledge delivery via AI-driven responses that democratize access to architecture insights across business units.
-Supports innovation and agility by enabling faster exploration of architectural options and impact analysis.

It uses GenAI powered agents to generate personalized responses, resolve complex issues, and take actions for customers.
 
Delta can leverage AI agents to elevate customer satisfaction (CSAT) and responsiveness to client inquiries across all communication channels. Decagon’s AI agents are designed to comprehend customer intent and context, enabling them to act on requests efficiently.

The pilot of this project was available on delta.com and has now expanded to the Fly Delta App.  Initial public facing traffic is to begin with 1% of US based SkyMiles users on version 7.5 of the Fly Delta app.

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore is an agentic platform to build, deploy, and operate highly capable agents securely at scale. AgentCore allows us to easily enable agents to take actions across tools and data, run agents securely with low-latency and extended runtimes, and monitor agents in production - all without any infrastructure management. 

The Enterprise AI and CCoE teams are collaborating to develop a suite of Generative AI Patterns on AWS to be consumed across other teams in Delta. These patterns will provide modular, reusable building blocks that can be integrated into their projects without deep AI/ ML expertise.​
The first three patterns that will be developed are as follows:​
Summarization Pattern - To enable users to receive concise summaries of their documents​
Database Chatbot Pattern – To enable users to analyze and query their data in natural language.​
Retrieval-Augmented-Generation Pattern – To enable users to ingest and index enterprise data, enabling LLMs to retrieve and ground responses in Delta-specific knowledge.​

AgentCore has been identified as the most viable option to host the Analytics agent of the Database Chatbot Pattern","AWS Bedrock AgentCore enables the organization to rapidly build, deploy, and scale intelligent AI agents without managing underlying infrastructure. Key business benefits include:
- Faster Development and Deployment - Provides a managed runtime and orchestration layer, allowing developers to focus on business logic and agent workflows instead of infrastructure setup or scaling.
- Operational Efficiency and Cost Control - Consumption-based pricing ensures we only pay for what we use.
- Improved Integration and Flexibility - Supports multiple AI models (including non-AWS ones) and integrates easily with existing AWS and enterprise systems.","- Agent Runtime & Orchestration
- Tool Integration Framework
- Memory Management - Provides short-term and long-term memory capabilities for agents.
- Observability and Monitoring - Offers detailed logging, tracing, and analytics of agent activities.
- Model Agnosticism - Supports any foundation model available on AWS Bedrock or through API integration
- Scalability and Reliability
- Extensibility and SDK Support
- Cross-Service Integration - Works seamlessly with other AWS services (e.g., S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch).","The data will be stored and processed within AWS (S3, Dynamo DB etc.)

The current development of patterns is in the Gen AI Dev account - genai-dev-867752000777

"scaleOPs","Morris, Aaron","Morris, Aaron",,"Business Essential","ScaleOps","New","Information Technology","ScaleOps is an intelligent Kubernetes resource optimization platform that automatically rightsizes workloads and manages cluster scaling to reduce cloud costs while maintaining application performance. The platform uses machine learning algorithms to analyze real-time resource usage patterns, predict future demand, and continuously adjust CPU and memory requests, limits, and replica counts without manual intervention. ScaleOps integrates seamlessly with existing Kubernetes environments, providing automated vertical and horizontal pod autoscaling, intelligent node scaling, and comprehensive cost visibility dashboards. By eliminating the guesswork in resource allocation, ScaleOps typically reduces infrastructure costs by 30-60% while preventing performance issues caused by under-provisioning, making it an essential tool for organizations looking to optimize their Kubernetes operations at scale.","Developer Tool","[""Permanent Production""]",,"11/5/2025 12:00 AM",,"Approved",,,,,"Approved","Approved","Approved","Approved","1",,,"aaron.morris@delta.com","No","COTS / Licensed","[""Yes""]","IaaS","No",,"New OpenShift Operator",,,,"No","Yes","Delta’s Kubernetes environments (ROSA/OpenShift) protect performance via over-provisioned CPU/memory requests and inflated replica minimums, creating persistent infrastructure waste and operational toil.
ScaleOps provides real‑time, performance‑first automation that aligns container requests and replica counts to actual demand, enabling safe node consolidation and lower EC2/ROSA/Dynatrace licensing without developer intervention.
Existing internal approaches (manual tuning, static policies) cannot react fast enough to traffic volatility (e.g., promos/IROPs), nor do they scale across multi-tenant nexGen clusters.
","Business drivers:
●	- Reduce AWS EC2 and ROSA subscription spend across ROSA clusters.
●	- Avoid incremental capacity purchases (“cost avoidance”) by densifying existing nodes.
●	- Lower Dynatrace host-based licensing by reducing node count.
●	- Free platform/app teams from manual right‑sizing to focus on higher‑value work.
Technical reasons:
●	- Dynamic pod rightsizing at creation time (no manifest changes) improves bin‑packing and triggers autoscaler scale‑downs.
●	- Predictive replica optimization removes HPA latency pressure, safely lowering min replicas off‑peak.
●	- Java‑aware policies respect Xmx/Xms and heap usage; burst reaction + auto‑healing protect SLOs during spikes.
","Real-time container CPU/memory rightsizing (per pod at creation via admission webhook; no GitOps conflicts).
●	predictive, policy-driven HPA/KEDA replica optimization (scale-out ahead of demand; safe scale-in off-peak).
●	Context-aware pod placement/bin-packing to increase node density.
●	Alignment with native Cluster Autoscaler/Karpenter to realize node scale-downs.
●	Performance safeguards: burst reaction, auto-healing on OOM/CPU stress/liveness failures.
●	Workload-level cost attribution and reporting to support FinOps.
","Primary mode (recommended for STR): **Self-hosted**. All telemetry, models, and dashboards run **in-cluster** within Delta’s ROSA/OpenShift environments; data remains in Delta’s VPC/regions.
Billing metadata: minimal metrics (e.g., aggregated vCPU counts) may be shared for license usage reporting.
Optional convenience: A cloud-hosted UI is available; if used, only limited metadata is transmitted over TLS 1.2+ to a ScaleOps endpoint. For STR, Delta will operate **self-hosted UI** to keep data fully in-cluster.
","Native / Open Source:
●	Kubernetes HPA/KEDA (horizontal only, reactive), Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) / OpenShift VPA (restarts required; conflicts with HPA), Goldilocks (advisory).
Commercial:
●	Perfectscale (vertical right-sizing), Kubecost (cost observability with advisory rightsizing).
Note: Alternatives generally lack simultaneous vertical + predictive horizontal automation without HPA conflict and/or GitOps conflict, or require restarts/manifest edits that impede broad automation.
","●	Status quo: Continue manual right-sizing and inflated min replicas → persistent over-provisioning (higher EC2/ROSA/Dynatrace spend).
●	Build in-house optimization: High engineering effort to reach parity (admission control, models, HPA decoupling, Java heuristics, safety reactions) and ongoing maintenance. Multi-year engineering effort with significant opportunity cost.
●	Rely solely on Karpenter/Cluster Autoscaler: Helps with provisioning, but does not solve inaccurate requests/min replicas driving waste.
","●	Deployment: Helm install per cluster; namespace/RBAC/NetworkPolicy setup.
●	Change management & STR/SecReview documentation.
●	Optional: GitOps integration (Argo/Flux), autoscaler policy tuning, outbound egress rule if using optional cloud UI.

Met with the team and the RAG pattern will not work for these reasons:

Key Gaps Identified
1. Architecture Incompatibility - The enterprise solution is a tightly-coupled system with integrated UI and backend. It does not expose APIs, making it incompatible with our custom UI.
2. Our UI Requirements - We provide functionality beyond basic chat:
◦ Downtime management for reservation specialists
◦ Admin and analytical dashboards
◦ Defect tracking
◦ Custom workflow integrations
3. Technical Differences
◦ We use OpenSearch (already performance-tuned); enterprise uses PostgreSQL
◦ We expose REST APIs for broader integrations
◦ We consume external data sources beyond S3
4. Strategic Direction - We're evolving toward an agentic approach (1-2 months) where the assistant will surface different tools and execute tasks autonomously for reservation specialists. This requires architectural flexibility the standardized solution doesn't provide.
5. Current Status - Our solution is built and ready. Enterprise solution is still in development (1-2 weeks from release).
Pavitra agreed during our discussion that the enterprise solution is not the right fit for our use case, noting it's designed for teams needing quick POCs or lacking resources, not to mandate all teams use it when they have specific requirements like ours.
Given these factors, we'd like to proceed with our existing architecture. Happy to discuss further if needed.

 ","The amazon-efs-utils package is a crucial component for working with AWS EFS because it simplifies the mounting process and provides essential security and management features that are not available with a standard Linux Network File System (NFS) client alone. SAP system requires a higher level of security.","The amazon-efs-utils package, particularly with the enhancements in v2, provides significant business benefits by improving operational efficiency, enhancing security, and boosting application performance:
Simplified Management: The mount helper utility automates complex configuration settings for mounting EFS file systems, reducing the manual effort and expertise required from IT staff. This allows engineering and operations teams to focus on building features and driving value for the customer, rather than managing storage infrastructure.
Seamless Integration: The package ensures smooth integration with other AWS services like AWS Lambda, ECS, and EKS, allowing businesses to easily modernize applications and build serverless or containerized architectures that require shared, persistent storage
Increased Throughput: The primary technical upgrade in v2, the efs-proxy, increases the maximum per-client throughput limit from 500 MiBps to 1.5 GiBps. This allows businesses to process data-intensive workloads (e.g., financial analytics, genomics, media processing) up to 3x faster, delivering insights more quickly and potentially lowering compute costs.
High Availability and Durability:  EFS is designed to be highly durable and available, storing data redundantly across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). The efs-utils package helps ensure robust connectivity, enabling applications to failover between AZs seamlessly, which is critical for business continuity and disaster recovery strategies.
Streamlined Security Implementation: The utilities simplify the implementation of encryption for data in transit using TLS. This ensures data protection and helps businesses meet stringent security and regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2) without the need for complex, manual configurations.
Granular Access Control: The mount.efs helper enables the use of IAM policies and EFS Access Points to control file system access at a fine-grained level, which is essential for managing multi-tenant environments securely.

- Due to this constraint application that are developed in Foundry that need LLM support for log analysis for predictive application we have to get this data sent to Delta managed AWS accounts with access to Bedrock and run it through an approved LLM. 

- This results in very inefficient architecture for the business. This prevents scaling of applications built in Foundry due to rate limits. We are using Claude 4.0 LLM for TechOps Applications Once Claude 4.0 is available in Foundry we can eliminate the need to send data to Delta managed AWS accounts and use this model for building applications inside of Foundry. 

- We are also requesting use of Claude 4.5, as this is the latest model available from Anthropic. This is needed to achieve improved predictive accuracy and contextual reasoning for the use cases that are described in business benefits. 

As additional need for using other LLMs (model families) arise a new STR will be submitted.

","1. AIP for CMM Parsing:
Component engineering, component maintenance, and others have requested parsed CMM content to help evaluate cost and improve planning for material requirements. One such use case ""make vs buy"" requires CMM content to be extracted from PDF documents and available to determine if it is a better business decision to bring repairs in-house vs continue to use external OSRs

2. AIP for Contract parsing:
Supply Chain wants to extract key information from contracts to ensure ""obligations"" are explicit and can be efficiently tracked and evaluated across the life of the contract.
Warranty wants to parse contact content and align with component information so that they can make claims and realize lost funds when materials fail prematurely.

3. MRO has a desire to parse contract content to support efficient contract development and customer negotiation.

4. MRO  has a desire to parse service bulletins to understand requirements for new customers and quickly develop contract pricing
Engine Maintenance wants to parse engine service manuals and IPCs to develop comprehensive material master information and digital work scope documents for engine repair (and integration into the existing UPS Foundry tool).
","AIP Overview: Attached document (Palantir AIP Architecture.pdf) has
1- a diagram that describes how AIP interacts with the rest of the Palantir platform; 
2- a diagram that provides a high-level description of the architecture and security controls 
3- details about AIP features.

AIP Governance: There is a strict governance and observability model for AIP built into the platform. There are controls in place at different levels, that can only be accessed and managed via administrators. 
   - Administrators must individually enable specific LLMs in the Control Panel. This ensures that only approved and enabled LLMs will be available on the platform. Follow this link for controlling AIP access. https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/aip/enable-aip-features#enable-llms.
  - Platform administrators can restrict available of different AIP applications by user groups. Follow the link for more details - https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/aip/enable-aip-features#restrict-aip-usage

AI ethics and governance: The link provides additional details on ethics and governance capabilities in Foundry. https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/aip/ethics-governance#platform-capabilities-5

AIP Features: Enabling AIP would provide access to several key features to expedite both business outcomes and developer productivity. Below are some examples:
1- AIP Document Intelligence - enable development of a 'Make vs Buy' tool for the Components team  for use case number 1 - AIP for CMM Parsing and 2. AIP for Contract parsing, which will lead to better decision-making and reduce costs.
2- AIP Assist - expedite training and onboarding efforts, increasing productivity for developers and platform end users
3- AIP Analyst - enable ad-hoc analysis using natural language for business users to enable better decision-making
4- AI Development Tools - AI FDE and other AI development tools will significantly reduce development and iteration time, and enable teams to build production-grade applications with the right permissions and controls, quicker and better. This will help with all of the business cases listed above, in terms of building the applications quicker.

"AWS ATX (Formerly AWS SEG (Super Elastic Gumby) )","Thakur, Sumit","Thakur, Sumit",,"Business Critical","AWS","Existing","Information Technology","Delta has completed the poc for AWS ATX (Formerly AWS SEG (Super Elastic Gumby) ). The GA release for ATX(SEG) is targeted in AWS reinvent tentatively by 5th December, 2025.
SEG is similar to Q CLI in that it is an agentic CLI tool that is designed for large scale code transformations, code interpretations, repeatable code updates (ie upgrade node version, java version, python version. There are several uses cases that during this preview we are looking to evaluate SEG for delta use cases:
1. Generating dependency map for each Delta gtilab repositories
2. To Serve DeveloperHub use-case, re-run atx for generating application level dependency map using repository level dependency map(associated to application).
3. Only member of respective git group and DX team will be able to trigger atx analysis
4. It will be made available to users through Developer Hub (Delta Internal Developer Portal - DEXDPLDHUB), it has Oauth2 authorization code pikce flow for authorization and LDAP & PING for authentication.
5. We are expecting to run for all delta repository and make it available to Delta IT through developer hub

Questions:
 1. Who are the users (and how many will there be)? Developer hub will be levaraged by all of Delta IT. To be able to trigger this workflow the user will be authenticated first thru PING and then fine grain access control will be handled via looking at the user role and see if they are in the teams sailpoint group. There are no direct users of this agent. This agent runs a predetermined workflow when triggered. There is also a CRON job that will run to keep dependencies up to date. Future state we are looking at hooking into gitlab MR's to trigger as updates occur. 
2. Thie references Agentic AI but it appears to be a sub-agent of some sort. It would be good to show this context in the architecture diagram. Currently it doesn't reflect any sort of Agentic AI contect. Diagram has been updated to show the two flows as mentioned above. This agent is essentially Q CLI running in headless mode but is designed for larger scale transformations
3. How will users be authenticated? Answered in question 1 but will sumerize here: Users are direct to PING following PCKE flow before any part of devhub loads. Users roles are validated for access to the project in devhub. If user has access then they can trigger dependency map to be generated. ",,"[""Permanent Production""]",,"11/19/2025 12:00 AM",,"Approved",,,,,"Approved","Approved","Approved","Approved","1","We have done the POC as per STR 1676 - AWS SEG (Super Elastic Gumby), now we want to move ahead and enable ATX(SEG) access in developer experience accounts.
1. devexp-si-647088722151 (647088722151)
2. devexp-prd-112078478450 (112078478450)

This agentic flow is leveraging AWS Transform (Its Q CLI transformation feature designed to run at scale and headless so its like a workflow with a predefined prompt). This process will only trigger by CRON or by approved app team to refresh the dependency map data. This data will be pushed to neptune and/or DDB table. 
 
From there when users load the application view in devhub we will not call any AI Flows or uses but will query neptune (graphdb) or DDB (still trying to determine what is best). In the future we are going to use this to tie into a custom agent (STR will come when were ready to support that) to generate SPAD and to help query natural language to understand dependencies amongst our applications. For now its going to be used in displaying dependency mapping and for SPAD generation we will leverage the neptune database (that contains the results of the depenency map) to generate the SPAD in the future",,"sumit.thakur@delta.com","No","COTS / Licensed","[""Yes""]",,,,,,,,,"Yes","There are several uses cases that during this preview we are looking to validate AWS ATX(SEG) for delta use cases in staging:
1. Dependency Mapping. Currently there is a gap at Delta to understand what App/Api/Component is calling or dependent on what. 
2. Code Library upgrades. Currently there are several teams that need to upgrade node and python versions. This is one of SEG core use cases to upgrade to latest versions of major frameworks
3. Code summarization: Developer Hub team has an immediate need to onboard existing gitlab repo's/applications into DeveloperHub. To do this we are looking for an agent tool (SEG) to provide the summary of the application so that we can understand the application type and components needed for onboarding
4. Code Library Dependencies: As part of the move from Veracode to Gitlab SAST scans, Security is needing a lockfile added to every repo. Java package managers do not have a concept of this like Node. We are looking at SEG to iterate thru the gitlab repos and create this file to automate this need for the migration","From the above uses cases there are several benefits we are looking to capture during the POC:
1. We can capture and maintain a dependency mapping of all apps/services at delta
2. We can auto create MR's for teams or teams can automatively create MR's to upgrade language versions to stay in compliance 
3. We can auto onboard the 30K repo's into developer hub vs having each team manual perform this action
4. We can auto create the java lock file needed for SAST migration to Gitlab vs having to ask each team to manual come up with this list","The product offers running code enhancements/summarization at scale with headless mode and AWS pre-tested templates for industry use cases like upgrading node 18 to 22","All data will stay within delta VPC","The only offering that is close would be Q CLI but it is lacking the scale of SEG and being able to run via automation. Q CLI requires human interactions.","We would need to look at creating a custom agent leveraging bedrock vs using the SEG agent that aws provides","During private beta there are no costs",,,"AWS will be provided support during the beta test",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This will close a big gap for delta on understanding what applications depend on.

We have successfully migrated our Xamarin projects to .NET MAUI. Most of these projects can be built using Visual Studio Code; however, the Flight Family Communication project requires Rider for its build process.","No","vishnu.tunguturi@delta.com","No","COTS / Licensed","[""No""]",,,,,"https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/#","https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/?section=mac",,,,"There are only three IDEs available for Mac OS for build Xamarin and .net MAUI apps.  
Visual Studio for Mac(discontinued)
VSCode
Rider 

We have been using Visual Studio for Mac/VSCode with Enterprise subscription for developing our Xamarin Enterprise apps.
We are unable to use the same for .Net MAUI apps due to various technical issues and limitations with VSCode.  

Technical issues: 
#1 – Our Xamarin and Maui Enterprise apps in Delta is designed as a multi-project solution with configuration setup for each environment – Dev, SI and Production.  
VSCode is not able to detect these custom configuration setups. It only runs in Debug/Release configuration which is not compatible with our existing setup.  
Team is unable to run the apps on different environments by switching the build scheme / configuration.  
The info.plist files disappears as VSCode is not detecting the custom configuration names. We cannot run an iOS app without a valid plist file for the configuration. 

 #2 – Configuration based on environment is critical especially in iOS because we have different provision profiles based on bundle identifier. Also, for apps supporting push notifications, we need to use SI configuration which we cannot do in Visual Studio for Mac/VScode currently. This creates a blocker for any development related to push notifications and its testing because we don’t have compatible IDE to do that. 

#3 – Platforms are not detected / allowed. In iOS we have 2 device platforms – iPhone and iPhoneSimulator. 
We create a simulator build for our Daf2 automation. With Visual Studio for Mac, it no longer allows us to create platform configurations which is a blocker for our automation as we are not able to create the simulator build. 

Rider solves all the issues mentioned above. That’s why we want to use Rider as our Primary IDE. 
Rider is compatible for all .net projects, and we want to use Rider as our Primary IDE as it is more advanced than Visual Studio for Mac. If we can get a subscription for Rider, it is possible that we can stop Visual Studio subscriptions. In future, if Visual Studio is required, we can use the community version. 
The Actual expectation of .Net Maui solutions are to work with VSCode but there have been numerous known issues, that clients are facing during their migration from Xamarin to .NET maui.  
 
Note - May be Microsoft will address the issues in future. if that happens, we can use the community-free versions and continue using Rider as our primary IDE for .NET related solutions.  ","1. Increased Developer Productivity
Faster Performance: Rider is lightweight and optimized for speed, especially on large solutions.
Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, which is great for distributed teams.
Advanced Code Analysis: Built-in inspections and quick fixes reduce bugs early in development.

2. Cost Efficiency
Single License for All Platforms: Unlike Visual Studio, which has different editions and pricing tiers, Rider offers a unified license.
Lower Hardware Requirements: Rider often runs smoother on less powerful machines, reducing infrastructure costs.

3. Better Integration
Seamless with JetBrains Ecosystem: Integrates with tools like TeamCity (CI/CD), YouTrack (issue tracking), and Space (collaboration).
Supports Multiple Frameworks: .NET, .NET Core, Xamarin, MAUI, Unity—all in one IDE.

4. Enhanced Code Quality
Refactoring Tools: Rider’s refactoring capabilities are among the best, improving maintainability.

Potential use cases include employee events, such as LEAD or Velvet, Museum or welcoming employees to their work area.  The proof of concept is meant to show capabilities and demonstrate new integrations for future implementations.  A successful POC will be a working integration that fully demonstrates how a potential project could leverage both Poppulo’s digital signage and Wicket’s facial biometrics solution.  Delta Air Lines has made significant investments in Employee Communications, Recognition, Satisfaction and Engagement.  This POC is designed to support those investments by creating new and innovative ways to engage with employees through the use of Delta’s existing digital signage network and Wicket’s biometrics platform.  The use cases go far beyond the scope of the POC, but we see this as a stepping stone towards how we might engage with new and existing employees, guests and visitors, and more.","The business benefit of completing this POC is to showcase new technologies and how they can work together with digital signage.  The POC aligns with our strategic goals of trying new technologies for the benefit of employees and passengers.   ","Post POC completion, we have identified a number of future use cases.  The Functional, Strategic, Operation and Integration capabilities are numerous.  

-Access Control - Wicket’s biometrics have already been adopted by the entire NFL at the League level for Employee, Player and Media access control and credentialing.    An employee's face is now their key card and allows them access to the appropriate and designed areas of the building they have access to.   Badges no longer need to be replaced or can be lost, because employees would use their face to unlock doors.   

-Payments - Along with access control, an employee's face can also be used to make purchases.  This could be applied to the Delta employee cafeteria or on-premise “store” where goods or services can be purchased.   With a simple scan of their face, their credit card can be charged or deduction from their paycheck can be applied.

-Guest / Visitor Check in - All guests and visitors planning to visit a Delta campus could use Wicket’s biometrics prior to visiting.  This will save time, validate guests ID’s, make the guest experience smoother and easier, and ensure Delta knows who all the guests are at any point in time, and restrict areas they are able to enter.  This is a massive safety and security benefit.

-Delta Conferences & Events - Wicket is already used by Fortune 100 companies like Salesforce and Nvidia for their company hosted events, like Dreamforce.   For any events, large or small, Wicket can act as your onsite registration for easy, smooth and frictionless entry.   As guests enter the conference area, they scan their face and their badge begins to print.

There are also benefits for Delta consumers.  This same technology can be used at Delta Sky Clubs, Ticketing, Boarding, etc.

The SharePoint connector uses delegated permissions, so user will sign in with their Delta ID and can only access files that they have access to.

Background:
Tyler Fenwick from the Financial Reporting Innovation team is requesting that we take Quick Suite (specifically Quick Research) through the STR process so that it can be enabled in the AWS Account he has requested.  This is an AWS Service that is still in the process of being sunrisen and until that point each team will have to take it through the STR Process for it to be enabled. 

The team was apart of a POC with QuickSuite led by Indu Tiwari's team.  During the POC they identified that using QuickSuite could save them ~8-16 hours of research time for Technical Accounting Research that is needed consistently on large transactions.  Based on this research their VP Julia McConnel would like to move forward with setting this up in an AWS which Tyler has already for 10 people to continue to use.  They will connect from their AWS Account to internal Delta SharePoint Sites and their own S3 bucket.

"TransPerfect Legal - eDiscovery tools vendor replacing KLDiscovery","Luth, James","Luth, James",,"Business","TransPerfect Legal","New","Legal","eDiscovery is the process of identifying, collecting, and producing electronically stored information (ESI) for legal or regulatory purposes. It’s commonly used during litigation, investigations, or audits to gather relevant digital data such as emails, documents, chats, and files.

TransPerfect Legal is providing eDiscovery and forensics services for litigation matters. They have specific expertise and tools that are needed (and that our other eDiscovery providers do not have), and that is why we need to onboard them. While they do offer Relativity as well, we are mainly using their REEF Review Suite of tools. Their proprietary tool is perfect for our smaller matters that do not require as many review tools/bells & whistles that Relativity offers at a higher price point. It is used to process, review and produce data that is relevant to the litigation. This process is required for all of our litigations, and certain matters require certain expertise (i.e. an IP litigation is different from a Second Request is different from an Antitrust action.). As such, we cannot use just one vendor for all of our needs. 
Only attorneys have access to the database as all work product and data collections are protected by the attorney-client privilege. 
Any AI being used also falls under attorney-client privilege. We are not generating NEW data, the analytics and AI functions are only used to categorize/review our documents so that we can produce the relevant/not privileged docs. There is a big difference between AI and GenAI, and we have been using AI tools in the eDiscovery space for over 20 years. It is standard practice to use AI tools for efficient review. 
The vendor services being provided are a combination of SaaS and Professional Services.  The technology that the Delta eDiscovery team will be using is not a separate subscription/installation.  ",,"[""Permanent Production""]",,"10/22/2025 12:00 AM",,"Pending",,,,,"Pending","Pending","Pending","Pending","1","eDiscovery collection transmission:
- SFTP - Standard transmission of eDiscovery collections is by SFTP: TransPerfect Legal has the capability to receive electronic files directly from clients using a secure mode of electronic transmission. We use the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) that requires SSH to be enabled. All data in transit is encrypted using TLS (version 1.2), VPN, and SFTP. All data at rest uses encryption with AES 256 algorithm.  
- Encrypted hard drives - For very large eDiscovery collections, transmission is by Physical Transmission: As a standard, they transfer data using 2TB encrypted hard drives. Amanda has the additional approvals required by Delta for using encrypted hard drives for processing.

MFA access management:
Amanda (manager for the Law Department's eDiscovery team) is the only one who will be approving access to the TransPerfect Legal workspaces. Only individuals specifically working on the matter (inside attorneys and outside counsel) will be provided access credentials. Also, Amanda audits the access log every month to remove access for anyone who has not logged in within the past 30 days. SSO is not feasible because of all the outside counsel that needs access.

- When a litigation matter is completed and Delta no longer needs to preserve the collected data, the workspace is deleted along with all originally collected data. Then, internally, Amanda's team removes the legal hold from Delta systems (because we preserve the original data in-place in our own environment.) The vendor keeps none of our data. Part of the reason all this goes through Amanda's team – so they can track where Delta's data is and make sure it’s deleted when it’s no longer needed.

We are phasing them out in order to phase in TransPerfect and their REEF tools. 
The ultimate benefit is lower legal fees. TransPerfect Legal enhancements allow us to work more efficiently, thereby reducing our outside spend on document review and analysis. It is more fitting for our smaller matters (with a lower doc review count) than a traditional Relativity review platform. From an eDiscovery perspective, it also makes sense for us to house our matters in a few different locations. ","The vendor services being provided are a combination of SaaS and Professional Services.  The technology that the Delta eDiscovery team will be using is not a separate subscription/installation.  TransPerfect Legal provides that at no cost within their cloud-based platform since Delta is utilizing their SaaS data hosting model and other professional services.
Keeping our (mainly) employment litigation matters with the same vendor/platform allows us to achieve the benefits of legacy knowledge and consistency across all of our matters. This is helpful because for the limited resources available to Delta's eDiscovery team (3 people).","TransPerfect and their REEF tools (and Relativity) give us high-speed analytics and review tools required for litigation matters, regulatory inquiries and internal investigations. It has all the capabilities and audit trails needed to keep our processes legal and defensible. The tool also prepares documents in the format required by our ESI Protocols, producing them in compliance with our legal obligations.","TransPerfect Legal hosts client data in colocation physical data centers on servers that are wholly owned and maintained by TransPerfect Legal. Delta projects will be managed wholly out of the US-based data centers. The data centers are listed below:
• 125 Belmont Drive, Somerset, New Jersey, 08873, United States (Rackspace New Jersey Two Facility).
• 12100 Sunrise Valley Drive, Reston, Virginia, 20191, United States (High Security Discovery Center).
The Somerset location backs up to their Reston location: 12100 Sunrise Valley Drive, Reston, Virginia, 20191, United States (High Security Discovery Center).
TransPerfect replicates data onsite and offsite and always maintains an onsite passive system that is ready to be utilized in the event of a common hardware failure on the primary system. Should both the primary and backup onsite systems fail, TransPerfect will utilize a secure offsite facility to which the data has been actively replicated. Backup of virtual machines is performed on daily basis. Software utilizes AES-256-bit encryption. ","TransPerfect Legal provides similar services to our other Relativity Providers – Epiq, PageOne, Lineal.  Relativity is an industry-standard review platform – which we currently utilize from a handful of different providers (due to their differing offerings). TransPerfect’s REEF tools are a better fit for our smaller matters that do not require a high data volume and/or advanced analytics offerings. ","We have other Relativity providers, but due to the subject-nature of this litigation, we need the specific tools they offer to meet our legal obligations. As stated above, from a privilege, business-continuity and eDiscovery perspective, it makes sense to have a few different service providers in this area.
If we don’t use the model implemented by the Delta eDiscovery team, the alternative is having each of our panel law firms choose their own eDiscovery service providers to handle our litigation matters. This means Delta has no insight into the security of those vendors, there is no guarantee they meet any of our requirements, and our proprietary data is floating around hundreds of places – most of which we cannot track/do not even know.

From Paul Love:
Approving since this is being noted as an emergency to support SOX compliance. 
Unless I hear otherwise, we need Internal Audit (Patrick Noll specifically) to be aware of this as he manages SOX. We should also make sure Darrin Hardy is aware as the sponsor of the Managed Software project to remove aged/old software and Richie Scammacca as the leader of the end user software components.

Software is out of support, need to move off of this as soon as possible. This software remains essential for supporting the Fuel Management System (FMS) due to its required libraries.
We currently have a capital project underway to migrate all FMS functionality to AWS, with a planned Go-Live date of October 1, 2026. Until then, this legacy software is critical for ongoing maintenance and support.

Continued use of MS Developer Studio is required for the below reasons until October 2026:
•	Over the past three years, our team has been actively rewriting the application using AWS technologies. Converting a 25-year-old application while keeping pace with environmental, legal, and business changes is a complex undertaking.
•	Improper code could impact Delta’s financial reporting and SOX compliance, so accuracy and stability are critical.
•	Microsoft Developer Studio is only being used for debugging and break-fix activities on the legacy system—not for enhancements.
•	All users run the application through Citrix. Only developers have a local version of the FMS product for debugging with MS Developer Studio. This setup is NOT internet accessible.
•	IT risk funding for this application has been declined for over 10 years.
•	The business has delayed decisions multiple times while evaluating options ranging from COTS products to small SaaS vendors and even SAP Oil and Gas Module with custom code.
•	We have empirical evidence that Microsoft Developer Studio can run on our current desktop environment, at least for the minimum functionality required.

ASI provides a single source of truth with ML-based predictive capabilities, proactive alerting, and Delta-specific data integration, enabling standardized decision-making and improved operational outcomes (10% diversion reduction, 0.2 point misconnect improvement). SPT endorsement: ""Best technology received in 20 years.
","ASI Network Manager delivers measurable ROI through multiple value streams:

COST AVOIDANCE:
• $650K+ annual savings from FlightAware sunsetting in 2H 2026
• Avoids internal development costs (estimated 6-12 months of IT resources)
• Eliminates need to replace 9+ FAA tools being sunset individually

OPERATIONAL SAVINGS:
• 10% reduction in diversions at $10K per diversion = significant monthly savings
• 0.2 point reduction in misconnects for weather/ATC-impacted flights = improved customer satisfaction and reduced rebooking costs
• 10% increase in proactive cancellations = reduced overbooking and rebooking expenses

EFFICIENCY GAINS:
• Consolidates 9+ separate tools into single platform, reducing manual data aggregation time
• Standardized decision-making across SPT personnel and shifts improves consistency
• Exception-based alerting provides more heads-up time for strategic planning
• Faster speed to decision-making reduces operational response time

","Data will be stored and processed on AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure managed by Airspace Intelligence (ASI). Specific AWS region(s) and data residency requirements to be confirmed during contract negotiation and security review. Delta will provide data to ASI via Tier 1 integration through secure API access layer. Data residency, retention policies, and compliance requirements will be defined in the vendor agreement to ensure alignment with Delta's data governance standards.
","Current State: SPT uses 9+ separate applications including FAA tools (NOD - Network Operations Database, TSD - Traffic Situation Display, Fuser, DIP from NASA, CDDR from NASA) plus OIS, FSM, TCF, COSP, Fusion, and Mosaic. These tools require manual data aggregation across multiple systems. FAA is actively sunsetting/discontinuing maintenance of critical tools (NOD, TSD, Fuser, DIP, CDDR). FlightAware is also sunsetting in 2H 2026 ($650K cost avoidance). ASI Network Manager is superior because it consolidates all these tools into a single platform with enhanced ML-based predictive capabilities, proactive alerting, and Delta-specific data integration. Internal development alternative was considered but would require significant time and resources that Delta does not have given the urgent FAA tool sunset timeline.
","If denied, Delta would face two critical alternatives: (1) Build internally - requires significant development resources and time (estimated 6-12 months minimum) that we do not have given FAA tool sunset urgency; this would divert IT resources from other strategic initiatives. (2) Continue with current fragmented toolset - operationally unacceptable as FAA is sunsetting critical tools, creating operational blind spots; SPT would lose situational awareness capabilities, increasing risk of diversions, misconnects, and suboptimal strategic decisions; additionally, FlightAware sunsetting would cost $650K+ in 2H 2026. Neither alternative is viable given operational criticality and timeline constraints.
","One-time implementation costs include:

Kaiser Permanente is expanding to the West Coast for 4 additional regions [North California, South California, Oregon, Washington]. 

In addition, Kaiser is incorporating AI in various use cases across their enterprise which will impact Delta. 

AI to Anticipate Members’ Care Needs:  

Social Health Needs: Kaiser Permanente is a pioneer in understanding and addressing social risk factors that influence health. We recognize that where we live often affects our health more than genetics. Up to 40% of health disparities can be attributed to social factors, such as access to healthy food, safe neighborhoods, and transportation to medical appointments. We use predictive modeling to systemically identify patients who lack access to these essentials. By analyzing electronic health record data, such as missed appointments or uncollected prescriptions, we can identify patients who might be struggling and reach out to address their social needs. 

AI to Support Care Operations: 

Generative AI for Clinical Documentation: We are using generative AI in the form of ambient listening technology to automatically generate a first draft of clinical notes from in-person patient visits. Physicians review and edit these notes before they are signed and entered into the electronic health record. This tool requires patient consent and can significantly reduce the time physicians spend on administrative tasks, allowing them to focus more on patient care. Before making this tool widely available, we conducted a rigorous quality assurance process, gathering feedback from thousands of doctors to ensure it works effectively for all patients, including non-English speakers. Our approach to quality assurance has been published in a peer-reviewed journal, and ongoing feedback from patients and clinicians continues to demonstrate positive experiences and high satisfaction with the tool. 

How does KP leverage AI to create operational efficiencies and improve the patient experience? Our culture of continuous improvement has consistently led to enhanced health care delivery and better patient outcomes through the application of evidence based practices and innovative approaches. In alignment with this tradition, we rigorously evaluate new AI technologies for their fit for purpose to ensure they are addressing the needs of our employees and patients. For example, our use of AI to support clinical documentation can significantly reduce the amount of time physicians spend on administrative tasks so they can dedicate more time to providing patient care. This may not only improve operational efficiency but also both clinician and patient satisfaction. ","Compliance

Business Problem:
Delta's IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system handles thousands of customer conversations daily through the Netomi AI platform. Currently, there is no automated, scalable way to evaluate conversation quality, adherence to Delta's protocols, and agent performance against established business rules. Manual review is time-consuming, inconsistent, and cannot scale to evaluate the volume of conversations needed for quality assurance and continuous improvement.

Solution:
The AI As Judge Dashboard provides an AI-powered evaluation system that:

Automates Quality Assessment - Uses AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to evaluate IVR conversations against Delta's business rules, greeting protocols, escalation procedures, and intent handling guidelines
Provides Actionable Insights - Generates detailed rubric-based evaluations (UAT-12, FTS-23) with scores and specific feedback on what was done correctly or incorrectly
Enables Data-Driven Decisions - Integrates with Redshift data lake to analyze conversation patterns, preview data, and identify trends across customer interactions
Centralizes Knowledge Base - Maintains Delta's IVR protocols, special handling rules, and intent definitions in a Bedrock Knowledge Base for consistent evaluation criteria

Key Benefits:

Scalability: Evaluate unlimited conversations automatically vs. manual sampling
Consistency: AI applies same evaluation criteria uniformly across all conversations
Speed: Real-time evaluation vs. days/weeks for manual review
Cost Reduction: Eliminates need for dedicated QA staff to manually review conversations
Continuous Improvement: Identifies training gaps and protocol violations quickly for corrective action
Compliance: Ensures IVR interactions meet Delta's customer service standards and regulatory requirements
Target Users:
IVR Operations Team (evaluate conversation quality)
Contact Center Managers (monitor agent performance)
Training Teams (identify coaching opportunities)
Business Analysts (analyze conversation trends)
Why Now:
The existing IVR system is operational but lacks quality monitoring capabilities. This creates risk of poor customer experiences going undetected and prevents data-driven optimization of the IVR system.","Qualitative Benefits:
Customer Experience Improvement
Consistent application of Delta's service standards across all IVR interactions
Faster identification and correction of conversation flow issues
Improved first-call resolution rates
Operational Excellence
Data-driven insights for IVR optimization
Objective performance metrics for continuous improvement
Standardized evaluation criteria eliminates subjective bias
Risk Mitigation
100% conversation monitoring vs. 5% sampling reduces compliance risk
Automated detection of protocol violations and escalation failures
Audit trail for regulatory compliance
Scalability
Solution scales automatically with conversation volume
No additional headcount needed as IVR usage grows
Supports future expansion to other contact center channels","Business Capabilities
AI-Powered Conversation Evaluation - Automatically evaluates 100% of IVR conversations against Delta's business rules and protocols using AWS Bedrock
Knowledge Base Management - Centralized repository of Delta's IVR protocols, greeting standards, intent definitions, and escalation rules
Conversation Search & Retrieval - Query and filter conversations by contact ID, date range, and keywords
Data Lake Analytics - Direct integration with Redshift for historical conversation analysis and trend identification
Evaluation Dashboard - Web interface to view conversation scores, detailed feedback, and performance metrics
Multi-Rubric Scoring - Structured evaluation using UAT-12 and FTS-23 rubrics with detailed breakdowns
API Access - RESTful APIs for integration with other Delta systems and automated workflows

1. AWS Bedrock Usage (Managed AI Service)
Uses AWS Bedrock with Claude 3.5 Sonnet model - a fully managed, enterprise-grade AI service
AWS Bedrock provides built-in security controls including encryption at rest/in transit, IAM-based access control, and audit logging via CloudTrail
No custom AI models are trained or deployed; only AWS-managed foundation models are used

2. Access Control &amp; Authentication
All Lambda functions use IAM roles with least-privilege permissions
API Gateway endpoints protected by custom authorizer (token-based authentication)
Cross-account Redshift access uses dedicated IAM role with read-only permissions
No public endpoints; all resources deployed within AWS VPC with security groups

3. Data Security
DynamoDB table stores conversation evaluations with encryption at rest (AWS managed)
S3 buckets for Bedrock Knowledge Base rules and dashboard files use server-side encryption
No PII or sensitive customer data is stored; only conversation metadata and evaluation results
Data in transit encrypted via HTTPS/TLS

4. Knowledge Base Security
