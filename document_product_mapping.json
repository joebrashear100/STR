This includes real-time gate information, On/off times, out/in times, etc.  There is no customer information sent to them.  In addition, SMAN receives aircraft location data from the aircraft transponders to place exact coordinates.  All of this information is displayed in both a map format and table formats for the user to make quick and efficient decisions in real time. Aerobahn tool is needed for direct surface surveillance of aircraft, to know and share with the ATC the arrival intent of inbound aircraft, and to have a tool in place that can communicate with the FAA's TFDM application (terminal Flight Data Manager). SMAN has all of the functionality that a tower operator would want for communicating with the FAA and other local SMAN users.  SMAN can be used to set business rules, charts and reporting, departure metering, deice management, etc.\nIt has local application authentication and authorization The user account is tied to the license. The user  and password can only be used in one session at any given time. That is the vendor solution to avoid/reduce the sharing of the account since license is per user. An installation of Aerobahn SMAN product at BOS, MSP for phase 1 and DTW and SLC for future phases. BOS will have 12 individual users and DTW will have 18 individual users."

Supply Chain will co-develop with AlixPartners in their secure Azure environment, leveraging open-source libraries and segregated LLM deployments. Access secured via Delta SSO and MFA for controlled collaboration.\n\nData Handling: Delta contract data will temporarily reside in AlixPartners\u2019 environment, protected by enterprise-grade security controls and governed by NDAs/MSAs.\n\nNext Steps: If the pilot demonstrates value, the solution will undergo a new approval process for permanent deployment and transition to Delta\u2019s AWS environment."

It is just a website with public delta information\nFor instance if the statement describes an MQD, the associated link would provide Delta explanation on what MQD is.\n \nDoes this show data about the member's travel details? No\n \nif so, how is that transferred to this site? NA\nHow will SkyMiles members login to see this site? There is no login needed by skymiles members.\n \nHow will administrators of our tenant login? And how many Delta people will that be? \nGALE is responsible for hosting the images and hyperlinks.

The last Vendor Risk Assessment done for Palantir was in 2024 and no security findings were found based on the completed Due Diligence Questionnaire.

        "description": "\nTechnology Solution Overview:\n\nDelta Air Lines proposes to implement a proof of concept integration with Palantir Foundry, a data analytics and decision support platform, to address critical operational visibility gaps in crew change management during irregular operations (IROPs).\n\nTechnical Architecture: The solution involves deploying Palantir Foundry connectors within Delta's AWS environment to establish secure, direct data feeds from five internal IT systems: Crew Management (Crew IT), Flight Operations, TechOps (aircraft maintenance), Airport Customer Services (ACS), and external airport curfew databases. Data flows through encrypted channels without intermediate storage in Delta AWS, connecting directly to Palantir's cloud-hosted analytics platform.\n\nFunctional Capabilities: The system will analyze real-time operational data to predict cascading effects of crew reassignments on subsequent flight operations. It will classify crew changes as \"good breaks\" (minimal downstream impact) or \"bad breaks\" (significant cascading disruptions), enabling Operations Control Center personnel to make informed decisions during irregular operations and minimize network-wide disruptions.\n\nTechnology Stack:\n\nPalantir Foundry (SaaS analytics platform)\nAWS-hosted integration layer with IAM, encryption, and audit controls\nDirect API integrations with existing Delta IT systems\nReal-time data processing and machine learning analytics\nWeb-based dashboard interface for OCC operators\nSecurity Controls: End-to-end encryption, role-based access controls, comprehensive audit logging, and secure VPN connectivity between Delta AWS and Palantir infrastructure. All data transmission occurs over encrypted channels with no persistent storage in intermediate systems.\n\nScope Limitations: Proof of concept is restricted to crew change impact analysis only, with no expansion to other operational domains without separate review and approval.\n"

The Trust Layer ensures that responses your agents generate are grounded in your trusted company data. And its zero-data retention policy means that your company and customer information will never be released into the wild. The Trust Layer detects potentially harmful LLM responses and includes event log monitoring for transparency in each user interaction. Topic instructions that define agent behavior also act as guardrails to prevent hallucinations and malicious attacks. The record and field access agents have, are permissions-based and can be set for different agent types and actions. \n\nThe Retro Credit Agent supports the end to end Retro Credit case resolution for Delta cases received from Delta.com (web to case) by confirming & validating the critical information (SkyMiles \n#, PNR #, Flight # Status etc.) and issues credit back to the customer alongside client communication.

And its zero-data retention policy means that your company and customer information will never be released into the wild. \n \nThe Trust Layer detects potentially harmful LLM responses and includes event log monitoring for transparency in each user interaction. Topic instructions that define agent behavior also act as guardrails to prevent hallucinations and malicious attacks.

        "description": "\nTechnology Solution Overview:\n\nDelta Air Lines proposes to implement a proof of concept integration with Palantir Foundry, a data analytics and decision support platform, to address critical operational visibility gaps in crew change management during irregular operations (IROPs).\n\nTechnical Architecture: The solution involves deploying Palantir Foundry connectors within Delta's AWS environment to establish secure, direct data feeds from five internal IT systems: Crew Management (Crew IT), Flight Operations, TechOps (aircraft maintenance), Airport Customer Services (ACS), and external airport curfew databases. Data flows through encrypted channels without intermediate storage in Delta AWS, connecting directly to Palantir's cloud-hosted analytics platform.\n\nFunctional Capabilities: The system will analyze real-time operational data to predict cascading effects of crew reassignments on subsequent flight operations. It will classify crew changes as \"good breaks\" (minimal downstream impact) or \"bad breaks\" (significant cascading disruptions), enabling Operations Control Center personnel to make informed decisions during irregular operations and minimize network-wide disruptions.\n\nTechnology Stack:\n\nPalantir Foundry (SaaS analytics platform)\nAWS-hosted integration layer with IAM, encryption, and audit controls\nDirect API integrations with existing Delta IT systems\nReal-time data processing and machine learning analytics\nWeb-based dashboard interface for OCC operators\nSecurity Controls: End-to-end encryption, role-based access controls, comprehensive audit logging, and secure VPN connectivity between Delta AWS and Palantir infrastructure. All data transmission occurs over encrypted channels with no persistent storage in intermediate systems.\n\nScope Limitations: Proof of concept is restricted to crew change impact analysis only, with no expansion to other operational domains without separate review and approval.\n"
